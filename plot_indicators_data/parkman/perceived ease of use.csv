Now you have to look at what the clock is and adjust the end time hours and minutes separately. May be suitable for rapper fans but not for me. When this change came, I immediately sent feedback and suggested that you could choose which feature to use from the menu. There was a green light that this could be done - sometimes. Not done yet!

I then stabbed the machine, and at night when I got off when paid parking would start. I stabbed the watch for a couple of hours. As it were, in the morning when I woke up very rested, the parking clock had spun the bill at night. During free parking. The couple of hours of parking had expired in that four countries at night, meaning the parking lot could have come to leave souvenirs. In addition, the ‚Ç¨ 10 subscription money had disappeared from my appis without leaving a trace, so this became a credit card bill. Yep, the sign-up money, which was still recorded with the promotional code when registering, disappeared before even the first parking had been completed.

Nowhere, of course, was it mentioned that the program would not follow the parking meter times set by the city. Really confusing experience, not to continue.

2438,Superfarmor,"Since I often park in Copenhagen, it's cool that you do not have to look for a parking meter, know in advance how long, etc. Parkman is super easy to use, costs only DKK 4 extra / parking and if you have problems / questions, you can email to parkman and get help / answers immediately. SUPER. Was nervous the first time I had to use it, but was so lucky that a couple of parking guards came and checked that everything was in order.(Incidentally cheaper than easy park)",5,2013-05-06 20:25:31,2.05,0.9441,positive,,
2439,furzer4ever,"easy to use without a doubt, but they have to earn money on all the times you forget to turn off the parking and in that way it costs far more than parking fines. if they can locate one's position via gps, parking should automatically stop when the gps location moves, so that one does not feel cheated every time one forgets to turn off the street parking.",3,2013-05-08 12:12:32,2.05,0.2283,neutral,,

2446,Klubvin.dk,Here's a cool app that just works. It is also good that the people behind the app listen to good ideas from the users and know how to translate these into useful functions that make it ever easier to use Parkman. Super simple and functional app that helps us who park in different zones to always pay the right thing and neither more nor less. Best wishesklubvin.dk,5,2012-12-19 21:28:58,2.0,0.9381,positive,,
