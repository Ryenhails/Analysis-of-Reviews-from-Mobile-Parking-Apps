I arrived at the parking lot at night, when there was free parking on the meter until eight, but I thought I would sleep a couple of hours longer. I then stabbed the machine, and at night when I got off when paid parking would start. I stabbed the watch for a couple of hours. As it were, in the morning when I woke up very rested, the parking clock had spun the bill at night. During free parking. The couple of hours of parking had expired in that four countries at night, meaning the parking lot could have come to leave souvenirs. In addition, the € 10 subscription money had disappeared from my appis without leaving a trace, so this became a credit card bill. Yep, the sign-up money, which was still recorded with the promotional code when registering, disappeared before even the first parking had been completed. (Or I paid € 13 for basically two hours of free overnight parking, which is an even more daunting option.) Nowhere, of course, was it mentioned that the program would not follow the parking meter times set by the city. Really confusing experience, not to continue. I got some sort of company parking sticker in the mail a couple of weeks later, an invoice three weeks after the event that picked up this review from my pen.

I paid for “security” 0-priced parking, i.e. the service fee was 49c, I didn’t pay for the parking itself. I don’t know what would have happened if the lizards had visited. Because the payment always goes according to the time spent, sometimes the parking itself becomes cheaper with the service fee than when paying with coins. In fact, I rarely park in paid places, so I’m happy to pay for the convenience of the app. The new version now comes with a maximum time for parking to end.
