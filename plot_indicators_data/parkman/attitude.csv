I then stabbed the machine, and at night when I got off when paid parking would start. I stabbed the watch for a couple of hours. As it were, in the morning when I woke up very rested, the parking clock had spun the bill at night. During free parking. The couple of hours of parking had expired in that four countries at night, meaning the parking lot could have come to leave souvenirs. In addition, the ‚Ç¨ 10 subscription money had disappeared from my appis without leaving a trace, so this became a credit card bill. Yep, the sign-up money, which was still recorded with the promotional code when registering, disappeared before even the first parking had been completed.

Nowhere, of course, was it mentioned that the program would not follow the parking meter times set by the city. Really confusing experience, not to continue.
