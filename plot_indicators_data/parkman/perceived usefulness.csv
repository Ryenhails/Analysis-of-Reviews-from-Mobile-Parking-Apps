I paid for ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù 0-priced parking, i.e. the service fee was 49c, I didn‚Äôt pay for the parking itself. I don‚Äôt know what would have happened if the lizards had visited.

Great that you do not have to look for a parking meter and that you only pay for your current time. Last but not least, you can always find your way back to the car. The app can only be recommendedüòä",5,2013-06-04 21:25:38,2.05,0.8501,positive,,
2438,Superfarmor,"Since I often park in Copenhagen, it's cool that you do not have to look for a parking meter, know in advance how long, etc. Parkman is super easy to use, costs only DKK 4 extra / parking and if you have problems / questions, you can email to parkman and get help / answers immediately. SUPER. Was nervous the first time I had to use it, but was so lucky that a couple of parking guards came and checked that everything was in order.(Incidentally cheaper than easy park)",5,2013-05-06 20:25:31,2.05,0.9441,positive,,
2446,Klubvin.dk,Here's a cool app that just works. It is also good that the people behind the app listen to good ideas from the users and know how to translate these into useful functions that make it ever easier to use Parkman. Super simple and functional app that helps us who park in different zones to always pay the right thing and neither more nor less. Best wishesklubvin.dk,5,2012-12-19 21:28:58,2.0,0.9381,positive,,
2447,HuntieDK,"It is so much cooler to use ParkMan than EasyPark (I use it in Copenhagen). No monthly subscription, and the GPS finds the place, so you do not have to enter the area number.",5,2012-08-07 07:58:12,1.12,-0.2263,neutral,,
