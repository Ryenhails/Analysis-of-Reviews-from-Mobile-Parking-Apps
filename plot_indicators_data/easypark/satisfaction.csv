Company in charge of managing paid parking in Bordeaux.How to navigate?What about the jackpot I had on my old application, since I had to make the advance? Nothing was returned to me at this day...Faced with this new consequent tax, disguised as a ""resident rate"" and having been sold to us as in front of us facilitating the parking in the district whereas it is even more difficult to put our 4 wheels near our residence since it is paying (installation of low poles, etc.)It is a vast swindle of those who cannot afford to park in their homes.Of course, no email is mentioned on the application for complaints or phone number for requests for help in case of need.As for the end of parking alert, now chargeable, it is scandalous.I will not dwell on the fact that the street which extends ours is not in the same charging zone and therefore, is at the maximum rate if we cannot find a place in our block or beyond. This is all maddening!I have a proposal to make: a single zone for all Bordeaux residents (and therefore Bordeaux taxpayers, already heavily taxed), identified by a sticker on the windshield, with free parking for one vehicle per dwelling.What do you think of all this?",1,2017-08-02,5.8.9,-0.8907,,1060,negative

When I used the parkman, it always found my position fairly quickly, but after the switch to easypark, it can take 10-20 seconds more. I always keep an eye on it finding the carmaker's street, because it may well place one on one of the streets next to it, but it is in the same zone (red). A little bit thin to blame the GPS as it obviously works fine with the parkman.

Or do both. 2) design suggestion: when you authorise payment, actively ask which car you want to pay for. Current design keeps the last parked car as default, therefore I got a parking fine a few times because I didn't notice I had chosen the wrong car. 3) design suggestion: allow for more than one simultaneous parking from the same app. E.g.

The company offers very few payment solutions, no e-invoice and charges the above fee, in addition to the parking fee, regardless of payment method.

This resulted in a fine as EasyPark had marked the wrong tariff / code. They take no responsibility at all for this. I'm far from the only one who has been affected. Feel free to read other reviews and other users' experience of EasyPark on e.g. trustpilot. I see that I have received an answer from the app developer. You should be extremely aware that the information presented in the app is not as simple as the app manufacturer wants it to appear. Also, do not forget that EasyPark makes its money regardless of whether you as a user are fined or not. But that says something about a parking company whose vision is to improve ""the Urban Experince"" instead of having the vision to help users easily park correctly and ensure that parking fines are avoided. I want to claim that EasyPark's GPS function helps to do the opposite and there are several reviews here from people who have experienced the same thing as me. In addition, the name of the app contributes to the problem, as it is promised to be simple, but in comparison with other services, it is the direct opposite. After further answers from where you claim that you want to try to help your customers as best as possible, the statement remains that you fail with it quite often (by the way, still looking for the Gallup survey that you refer to on your website regarding customer satisfaction). And ang. If I have been in contact with your customer service, yes of course I have. At first glance, it looks like a professional answer, but for anyone who has parked at some point and then been fined, I dare say that your answer is perceived as extremely condescending. For those of you who read this review, really take a look at other people's reviews also regarding EasyPark and its app and think about whether there might not be a better alternative when you park. (For example, a company that also takes care of the fine and in this way actually has a much greater responsibility and thus better opportunities to really help parking customers than a company like EasyPark).

Then you can park somewhere else, they would probably say. Others will say, get your shit done and be a little customer friendly the hours it takes until you get your vending machines done. You almost pray even if the ordinary citizen gets furious at the guards and they risk having a very uncomfortable day.

The speed of the registration of which zone you are in, and the ease of use in that you become aware of a possible incorrect registration while you are on the go, I consider to be extremely poor compared to other parking apps. In that case, there was no question that I had left the car or that I had otherwise made a remote registration. It was just that the app had not managed to register my location correctly (despite the fact that I always give it some time when I open the app) and that I was not aware that it had not registered it correctly. The parking ticket was my mistake and therefore I paid for it, but I definitely think that the app can handle a software update that makes it faster to register the location, as it takes a long time. Again, this is alone compared to other parking apps.In addition, one could consider whether the usability of the app should be updated so that the user can not avoid seeing or getting checked that it is in the wrong zone that is registered.",1,2018-10-24,11.5,-0.7725,,4157,negative

4985,Barandur,"The transaction fees are very often extremely high in relation to the parking fee, actually usury !!!Alternatively, take a look at the provider ParkNow! There are fees with every transaction! That in itself is completely understandable. The provider has to finance itself somehow, since the actual parking fee has to be paid back to the city. At easypark, these transaction fees can either be fixed and independent of the parking fees or they depend on the parking fee, which is the case in most of the parking zones at easypark! In the latter variant, the transaction fee can be very, very expensive!In Berlin, for example, it is 15% of the parking fee, but at least ‚Ç¨ 0.49 !!!49 cents is only 15% from a parking fee of around ‚Ç¨ 3.27!In Berlin, one hour usually costs ‚Ç¨ 1!So I would have to park for almost 3.5 hours so that I really only pay 15% of the parking fee as a transaction fee! From then on it becomes more and more expensive with the transaction fee!There are also parking zones in Berlin, where you pay ‚Ç¨ 2 per hour from 6pm to midnight. The 15% transaction fee for easypark is worthwhile from 1:45 a.m. parking time! Because from then on the transaction fee rises continuously! If I also consider that I often only park somewhere for half an hour for 50 cents, then the transaction fee is almost 100% of the parking fee and that's really bold! What actually happens if I want to extend the parking time? Do I then pay at least 49 cents again? There is another way:At ParkNow you only pay 25 cents per bookingor alternatively ‚Ç¨ 2.99 / month without charge per booking.1.67 That is why easypark only gets 1 star!",1,2019-02-23,12.5,0.7992,,4985,positive
4988,geplagter Handyparkkunde,"Somebody was probably not paying attention and implemented the design draft of a nine-year-old girl without thinking too much. Even minor updates keep changing the UI, with a clear tendency ""confusing"" and ""even more pink"". Obvious activities such as setting the parking time etc. are hidden behind overloaded, pink rotary controls which, when cranking, also like to trigger a paid parking process at the same time. It has to look for Easter eggs first (yes, where could it be this time) and then a gambling component, great! Therefore, in case the gentlemen should have forgotten: The minimal task was a digital parking ticket. But they preferred to build an annoying app that repeatedly forces unexpected user interaction. _Everything_ shines really well with a lot of blingbling - just howling when you look at the average parking meter as an alternative. It seems to be particularly important to the current crew to display unexpected and pointless comments between the customers and the start of the parking process. Yesterday I had to talk to the policewoman for a long time because a parking process was ultimately not started. The app really wanted to tell me modally that I needed such a sticker in the car. Oh no, great thanks: I've been a ""mobile phone parking customer"" for 10+ years, and thus probably have a much longer business relationship with the company than most of my developers there. But I didn't know that I needed a sticker as a reference for the Zettelhex ... I'm curious when I will be told that cats cannot be dried in the microwave. Honestly, hopefully it will be something else, otherwise I'll switch back to change and parking machines, it doesn't sting so much in the eyes and it hurts a lot less behind the forehead.",1,2017-12-15,10.2,0.9731,,4988,positive

It was completely clear to me: these are the pure parking fees. So far so good, until I asked for an invoice. And lo and behold: in addition to the parking fee, I am charged 12 cents in transaction costs for each transaction. This is not shown or displayed anywhere (neither in the app store, on the website, nor anywhere else). If it is somewhere and I haven't found it, I beg your forbearance, at least I haven't found anything despite an intensive search.

Easypark dismisses and believes users need to read The Little Scriptures better. Many users have also complained that Easypark pulls for the same parking several times. I am one of them. Again, the developer rejects everything as a user error.  I myself immediately contacted customer service when the app notified me that my parking was about to expire - several days after I had purchased a 24-hour parking. But here I could thank myself. The developer maintains that I as a user must understand that active 24-hour parking does not appear on the app's opening page, as other parking does, and that the user must orient themselves in the submenus, find out if Easypark has charged the user for more than one day, and then take contact customer service before the first 24 hours have passed.

One thing I think could have been an improvement is this with the choice of car and registration number. Here it is very easy to make mistakes as a user, which for me and many others has resulted in a fine - despite the fact that you have actually paid, but for a registration number that does not exist or a car that was obviously not in the parking lot. One idea could be to have a two-step registration of car numbers, so that it is easier to detect errors in registration if these two do not match. Or possibly a check against a register, which means that the registration number that does not exist is not approved by the app, and checks if the first two letters are in the registration number at all. Personally, I missed ""f"" and pressed ""r"" in a hurry - and ""NR"" does not exist. But the cure was there, because this was my fault, which I agree with! (Despite the fact that I think the parking attendant should have looked for the car he had paid for, and not found this, and then looked between his fingers and thought ""here is someone who has been human to misprint in the app"".) By improving it I have mentioned above, I think the app would be more ""foolproof"" and even more would have enjoyed and trusted the app, and that parking attendants do not have to take the brunt of the user's mistakes - which is often awkward to admit as a user :)",3,2019-03-03,12.6,0.9737,,8609,positive

It is possible that the application is only for gifted people, so I will unsubscribe as soon as the claim that I have filed with the City Council is resolved.
