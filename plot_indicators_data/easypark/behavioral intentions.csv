Current design keeps the last parked car as default, therefore I got a parking fine a few times because I didn't notice I had chosen the wrong car. 3) design suggestion: allow for more than one simultaneous parking from the same app. E.g.

Feel free to read other reviews and other users' experience of EasyPark on e.g. trustpilot. I see that I have received an answer from the app developer. You should be extremely aware that the information presented in the app is not as simple as the app manufacturer wants it to appear. Also, do not forget that EasyPark makes its money regardless of whether you as a user are fined or not.

I want to claim that EasyPark's GPS function helps to do the opposite and there are several reviews here from people who have experienced the same thing as me. In addition, the name of the app contributes to the problem, as it is promised to be simple, but in comparison with other services, it is the direct opposite.

And ang. If I have been in contact with your customer service, yes of course I have. At first glance, it looks like a professional answer, but for anyone who has parked at some point and then been fined, I dare say that your answer is perceived as extremely condescending. For those of you who read this review, really take a look at other people's reviews also regarding EasyPark and its app and think about whether there might not be a better alternative when you park.

It was just that the app had not managed to register my location correctly (despite the fact that I always give it some time when I open the app) and that I was not aware that it had not registered it correctly. The parking ticket was my mistake and therefore I paid for it, but I definitely think that the app can handle a software update that makes it faster to register the location, as it takes a long time.

One thing I think could have been an improvement is this with the choice of car and registration number. Here it is very easy to make mistakes as a user, which for me and many others has resulted in a fine - despite the fact that you have actually paid, but for a registration number that does not exist or a car that was obviously not in the parking lot. One idea could be to have a two-step registration of car numbers, so that it is easier to detect errors in registration if these two do not match. Or possibly a check against a register, which means that the registration number that does not exist is not approved by the app, and checks if the first two letters are in the registration number at all. Personally, I missed ""f"" and pressed ""r"" in a hurry - and ""NR"" does not exist. But the cure was there, because this was my fault, which I agree with!

If you claim it and show that you were on the correct street but the application picks up a different one, its answer is that it is your responsibility and be attentive. What do you want this App for if it doesn't do it automatically? Do not trust yourself and check well where it locates you.",1,2020-11-11,15.12.1,0.102,,10719,neutral

They annoy the 19 cents per operation but it is compensated by putting the maximum time and then stopping it when you leave, so they only charge you for the time you are there.
