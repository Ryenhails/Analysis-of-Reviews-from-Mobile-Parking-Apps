It's definitely faster than spinning the wheel.

Either change to 1 hour intervals wihout the dial button, or interpolate price to 10 minute intervals, as the paper bills allow already. Or do both. 2) design suggestion: when you authorise payment, actively ask which car you want to pay for. Current design keeps the last parked car as default, therefore I got a parking fine a few times because I didn't notice I had chosen the wrong car. 3) design suggestion: allow for more than one simultaneous parking from the same app. E.g.

How each invoice completely sonic can also get a mandatory half-hidden surcharge cost of 15% in retrospect instead of the cost of the parking itself (the one you as a customer see) also feels worth thinking about. It is also worth noting how this unavoidable surcharge is also stated to amount to a minimum of SEK 5 - ie. in many cases, perhaps closer to 50% of the invoice cost for, for example, those who park for a shorter period of time or in less expensive parking spaces. The company offers very few payment solutions, no e-invoice and charges the above fee, in addition to the parking fee, regardless of payment method.

This resulted in a fine as EasyPark had marked the wrong tariff / code. They take no responsibility at all for this. I'm far from the only one who has been affected. Feel free to read other reviews and other users' experience of EasyPark on e.g. trustpilot. I see that I have received an answer from the app developer. You should be extremely aware that the information presented in the app is not as simple as the app manufacturer wants it to appear. Also, do not forget that EasyPark makes its money regardless of whether you as a user are fined or not. But that says something about a parking company whose vision is to improve ""the Urban Experince"" instead of having the vision to help users easily park correctly and ensure that parking fines are avoided. I want to claim that EasyPark's GPS function helps to do the opposite and there are several reviews here from people who have experienced the same thing as me. In addition, the name of the app contributes to the problem, as it is promised to be simple, but in comparison with other services, it is the direct opposite. After further answers from where you claim that you want to try to help your customers as best as possible, the statement remains that you fail with it quite often (by the way, still looking for the Gallup survey that you refer to on your website regarding customer satisfaction). And ang. If I have been in contact with your customer service, yes of course I have. At first glance, it looks like a professional answer, but for anyone who has parked at some point and then been fined, I dare say that your answer is perceived as extremely condescending. For those of you who read this review, really take a look at other people's reviews also regarding EasyPark and its app and think about whether there might not be a better alternative when you park. (For example, a company that also takes care of the fine and in this way actually has a much greater responsibility and thus better opportunities to really help parking customers than a company like EasyPark).

A big disadvantage is that after you have started your parking, it is at least as easy to accidentally end it. I did. It cost me SEK 750. I am moody. In the app, you end the parking at the exact same place where you start it. You do not need to confirm that you want to end the parking elsewhere on the screen. The app may be nicer in that way, but for me it meant that after I had started the parking, I ran towards the train, threw the phone in my pocket. There in my pocket I happened to finish my parking. Unintentionally. Now the next time I parked, I checked lots of times that the parking is running. An alternative to avoid these mistakes is to close the app. But the backbone feeling says no. What happens when you shut down Netflix or Spotify ... well the movie or music ends. It's a bit the same feeling to shut down the app. What makes me feel safe with my parking not closing?

The ease of use (both with the phone and the app) is also good - if you have got used to a few specific terms. E.g. ""complete the parking process"" means that the parking is ended - more clearly would be ""end the parking process"". Is only a small example and does not limit the absolutely positive evaluation.

One thing I think could have been an improvement is this with the choice of car and registration number. Here it is very easy to make mistakes as a user, which for me and many others has resulted in a fine - despite the fact that you have actually paid, but for a registration number that does not exist or a car that was obviously not in the parking lot. One idea could be to have a two-step registration of car numbers, so that it is easier to detect errors in registration if these two do not match. Or possibly a check against a register, which means that the registration number that does not exist is not approved by the app, and checks if the first two letters are in the registration number at all. Personally, I missed ""f"" and pressed ""r"" in a hurry - and ""NR"" does not exist. But the cure was there, because this was my fault, which I agree with! (Despite the fact that I think the parking attendant should have looked for the car he had paid for, and not found this, and then looked between his fingers and thought ""here is someone who has been human to misprint in the app"".) By improving it I have mentioned above, I think the app would be more ""foolproof"" and even more would have enjoyed and trusted the app, and that parking attendants do not have to take the brunt of the user's mistakes - which is often awkward to admit as a user :)",3,2019-03-03,12.6,0.9737,,8609,positive

5358,AlecoTG,"They have charged me more than 8 euros while the app indicated that the parking was worth 0 euros. Suspecting that this could not be normal, I paid the physical ticket anyway. I was surprised when they deducted the money from the bank. I called them on the phone and wrote to customer service twice with explanations, screenshots, photos of the physical ticket of the official parkmeter purchased that I made in case so that it could be seen that I did not base myself on the parking app ... and That was more than two months ago and they still haven't given me a solution. Reporting for that sum is not worth it but the star here stays and will return if the score is reset by update or they change their name.",1,2018-09-13,11.2.1,0.1197,,10755,neutral
