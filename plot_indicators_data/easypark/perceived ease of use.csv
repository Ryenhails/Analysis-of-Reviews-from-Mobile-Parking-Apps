Either change to 1 hour intervals wihout the dial button, or interpolate price to 10 minute intervals, as the paper bills allow already. Or do both. 2) design suggestion: when you authorise payment, actively ask which car you want to pay for. Current design keeps the last parked car as default, therefore I got a parking fine a few times because I didn't notice I had chosen the wrong car. 3) design suggestion: allow for more than one simultaneous parking from the same app. E.g.

It is also worth noting how this unavoidable surcharge is also stated to amount to a minimum of SEK 5 - ie. in many cases, perhaps closer to 50% of the invoice cost for, for example, those who park for a shorter period of time or in less expensive parking spaces. The company offers very few payment solutions, no e-invoice and charges the above fee, in addition to the parking fee, regardless of payment method.

Of course you do not want to get that fee! The fact that it is then complicated with settings and that it is also difficult to interpret where you can park when you visit Malm√∂ means that the risk of parking fees is super high.

3200,thadvnt79,"Used EasyPark's GPS positioning to find the parking lot. After the app identified exactly where I stood, I started parking. This resulted in a fine as EasyPark had marked the wrong tariff / code. They take no responsibility at all for this. I'm far from the only one who has been affected. Feel free to read other reviews and other users' experience of EasyPark on e.g. trustpilot. I see that I have received an answer from the app developer. You should be extremely aware that the information presented in the app is not as simple as the app manufacturer wants it to appear. Also, do not forget that EasyPark makes its money regardless of whether you as a user are fined or not. But that says something about a parking company whose vision is to improve ""the Urban Experince"" instead of having the vision to help users easily park correctly and ensure that parking fines are avoided. I want to claim that EasyPark's GPS function helps to do the opposite and there are several reviews here from people who have experienced the same thing as me. In addition, the name of the app contributes to the problem, as it is promised to be simple, but in comparison with other services, it is the direct opposite. After further answers from where you claim that you want to try to help your customers as best as possible, the statement remains that you fail with it quite often (by the way, still looking for the Gallup survey that you refer to on your website regarding customer satisfaction). And ang. If I have been in contact with your customer service, yes of course I have. At first glance, it looks like a professional answer, but for anyone who has parked at some point and then been fined, I dare say that your answer is perceived as extremely condescending. For those of you who read this review, really take a look at other people's reviews also regarding EasyPark and its app and think about whether there might not be a better alternative when you park. (For example, a company that also takes care of the fine and in this way actually has a much greater responsibility and thus better opportunities to really help parking customers than a company like EasyPark).

There is no point in complaining. You have to check for signs that hang far away. So ‚ÄúParking Made Easy‚Äù is somewhat misleading. It should be called ""Paying and Paying and Paying Made Easy"" ... because that part works pretty well. Dear Happiness-MajaIt is simply not good enough to blame the phone. When users receive fines even though they have demonstrably paid with the app, then the TOTAL SERVICE DOES NOT WORK. And everything else is just what is important to the user. It should not be difficult to understand. You should make sure that there is only one zone in each place for the location service to work. You have to work with the phone instead of making leg braces for the user. It would be parking made easy.",1,2019-10-31,14.3,0.827,,4044,positive

The speed of the registration of which zone you are in, and the ease of use in that you become aware of a possible incorrect registration while you are on the go, I consider to be extremely poor compared to other parking apps. In that case, there was no question that I had left the car or that I had otherwise made a remote registration. It was just that the app had not managed to register my location correctly (despite the fact that I always give it some time when I open the app) and that I was not aware that it had not registered it correctly. The parking ticket was my mistake and therefore I paid for it, but I definitely think that the app can handle a software update that makes it faster to register the location, as it takes a long time.

One thing I think could have been an improvement is this with the choice of car and registration number. Here it is very easy to make mistakes as a user, which for me and many others has resulted in a fine - despite the fact that you have actually paid, but for a registration number that does not exist or a car that was obviously not in the parking lot. One idea could be to have a two-step registration of car numbers, so that it is easier to detect errors in registration if these two do not match. Or possibly a check against a register, which means that the registration number that does not exist is not approved by the app, and checks if the first two letters are in the registration number at all. Personally, I missed ""f"" and pressed ""r"" in a hurry - and ""NR"" does not exist. But the cure was there, because this was my fault, which I agree with! (Despite the fact that I think the parking attendant should have looked for the car he had paid for, and not found this, and then looked between his fingers and thought ""here is someone who has been human to misprint in the app"".) By improving it I have mentioned above, I think the app would be more ""foolproof"" and even more would have enjoyed and trusted the app, and that parking attendants do not have to take the brunt of the user's mistakes - which is often awkward to admit as a user :)",3,2019-03-03,12.6,0.9737,,8609,positive

All offered tariff groups gathered different types of parking, of which 2 out of three were entitled ""Garage"" and I consequently chose ""Street parking"" instead since I was parked outdoors. As it appears from my history, I have paid for hours and expensively for the place, but by using the place service I have chosen the wrong rate group. The guard who imposed the fine on me did not know about ""Easy park"", despite the fact that he imposed fines on the area, nor did he take the time to check surrounding tariff groups if this car had paid. To closely analyze offered tariff group titles or memorize a multi-digit tariff group digit readable but undercommunicated a good distance away at the vending machine, when a location service on a mobile (!) App is offered, is not ok. When complaining, Easy Park points out that one should read the terms of the app closely, and they do not go back on the fine even though they can see that I have paid.

I got an answer today and during the day and after a reinstall today it works again! Brilliant!! Also get a receipt on sms !! Now only GPS function is missing so the app gets top marks from me !!  Previous mention: I use EasyPark diligently and have saved large amounts on parking. Arguments that it costs a lot to use EasyPark do not hold if you park a lot and for example are a lot in meetings with a somewhat uncertain end time. EasyPark is an ingenious solution and the app worked well to begin with, but for far (!) Long now it has not worked properly. I wrote an email to EasyPark about this several months ago where they replied that they are working hard to fix this. It turns out (obviously) that is not true. The concept is ingenious. Had the app worked, it would also have been ingenious, but now I only use the ring solution until further notice.

I understand that the city council can set some rules, but if so, then EasyPark should change the current design of the payment mode (at least in Madrid, put separate buttons for selecting time and payment) so that it is not so easy to make the mistake to pay for a parking that you do not want to do or for the unwanted time. Otherwise, it will seem that they want to take advantage of all those charges committed by mistake.
