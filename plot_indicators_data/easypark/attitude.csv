Current design keeps the last parked car as default, therefore I got a parking fine a few times because I didn't notice I had chosen the wrong car. 3) design suggestion: allow for more than one simultaneous parking from the same app. E.g.

2949,Erkkii,"The opposite of respect for the customer. Takes at least 15% surcharge on each invoice for, according to its own statement, so-called ""Innovative parking solutions"". What is innovative with a white painted window on asphalt can of course be discussed. How each invoice completely sonic can also get a mandatory half-hidden surcharge cost of 15% in retrospect instead of the cost of the parking itself (the one you as a customer see) also feels worth thinking about. It is also worth noting how this unavoidable surcharge is also stated to amount to a minimum of SEK 5 - ie. in many cases, perhaps closer to 50% of the invoice cost for, for example, those who park for a shorter period of time or in less expensive parking spaces. The company offers very few payment solutions, no e-invoice and charges the above fee, in addition to the parking fee, regardless of payment method. If you fail to opt out of a paper invoice, you have a SEK 25 distribution fee (quite juicy even that for a parking fee of SEK 8).

3098,Oscar Kjellberg,"Had to change from SMS Park to Easy Park. What a difference, SMS Park worked flawlessly, while this app incessantly hassles with various error messages. In addition, you charge a service fee of at least SEK 4.95 or 15% on parking (becomes interesting when you park where the first 3 hours are free, then it suddenly costs SEK 4.95), you charge a fee for a reminder SMS that the parking time is running out etc. Just lots of fees for miscellaneous, what is the next step, to charge for logging in to the app maybe? Scarce and hard-to-find information, the app refers to the website's home page instead of taking one to what you are looking for. Everything is designed to make it as difficult as possible for users so that Easy Park can charge as much as possible and write as many parking fines as possible.

This resulted in a fine as EasyPark had marked the wrong tariff / code. They take no responsibility at all for this. I'm far from the only one who has been affected. Feel free to read other reviews and other users' experience of EasyPark on e.g. trustpilot. I see that I have received an answer from the app developer. You should be extremely aware that the information presented in the app is not as simple as the app manufacturer wants it to appear. Also, do not forget that EasyPark makes its money regardless of whether you as a user are fined or not.

I want to claim that EasyPark's GPS function helps to do the opposite and there are several reviews here from people who have experienced the same thing as me. In addition, the name of the app contributes to the problem, as it is promised to be simple, but in comparison with other services, it is the direct opposite.

And ang. If I have been in contact with your customer service, yes of course I have. At first glance, it looks like a professional answer, but for anyone who has parked at some point and then been fined, I dare say that your answer is perceived as extremely condescending.

A big disadvantage is that after you have started your parking, it is at least as easy to accidentally end it. I did. It cost me SEK 750. I am moody. In the app, you end the parking at the exact same place where you start it. You do not need to confirm that you want to end the parking elsewhere on the screen. The app may be nicer in that way, but for me it meant that after I had started the parking, I ran towards the train, threw the phone in my pocket. There in my pocket I happened to finish my parking. Unintentionally. Now the next time I parked, I checked lots of times that the parking is running. An alternative to avoid these mistakes is to close the app. But the backbone feeling says no. What happens when you shut down Netflix or Spotify ... well the movie or music ends. It's a bit the same feeling to shut down the app. What makes me feel safe with my parking not closing?

Ok I log in to their website and try to create a user but after entering all my information and pressing save nothing happens. Test again and same thing. Incredible.

There are fees with every transaction! That in itself is completely understandable. The provider has to finance itself somehow, since the actual parking fee has to be paid back to the city. At easypark, these transaction fees can either be fixed and independent of the parking fees or they depend on the parking fee, which is the case in most of the parking zones at easypark! In the latter variant, the transaction fee can be very, very expensive!In Berlin, for example, it is 15% of the parking fee, but at least € 0.49 !!!49 cents is only 15% from a parking fee of around € 3.27!In Berlin, one hour usually costs € 1!So I would have to park for almost 3.5 hours so that I really only pay 15% of the parking fee as a transaction fee! From then on it becomes more and more expensive with the transaction fee!There are also parking zones in Berlin, where you pay € 2 per hour from 6pm to midnight. The 15% transaction fee for easypark is worthwhile from 1:45 a.m. parking time! Because from then on the transaction fee rises continuously! If I also consider that I often only park somewhere for half an hour for 50 cents, then the transaction fee is almost 100% of the parking fee and that's really bold! What actually happens if I want to extend the parking time? Do I then pay at least 49 cents again?

4988,geplagter Handyparkkunde,"Somebody was probably not paying attention and implemented the design draft of a nine-year-old girl without thinking too much. Even minor updates keep changing the UI, with a clear tendency ""confusing"" and ""even more pink"". Obvious activities such as setting the parking time etc. are hidden behind overloaded, pink rotary controls which, when cranking, also like to trigger a paid parking process at the same time. It has to look for Easter eggs first (yes, where could it be this time) and then a gambling component, great! Therefore, in case the gentlemen should have forgotten: The minimal task was a digital parking ticket. But they preferred to build an annoying app that repeatedly forces unexpected user interaction. _Everything_ shines really well with a lot of blingbling - just howling when you look at the average parking meter as an alternative. It seems to be particularly important to the current crew to display unexpected and pointless comments between the customers and the start of the parking process. Yesterday I had to talk to the policewoman for a long time because a parking process was ultimately not started. The app really wanted to tell me modally that I needed such a sticker in the car. Oh no, great thanks: I've been a ""mobile phone parking customer"" for 10+ years, and thus probably have a much longer business relationship with the company than most of my developers there. But I didn't know that I needed a sticker as a reference for the Zettelhex ... I'm curious when I will be told that cats cannot be dried in the microwave.

It was completely clear to me: these are the pure parking fees. So far so good, until I asked for an invoice. And lo and behold: in addition to the parking fee, I am charged 12 cents in transaction costs for each transaction. This is not shown or displayed anywhere (neither in the app store, on the website, nor anywhere else). If it is somewhere and I haven't found it, I beg your forbearance, at least I haven't found anything despite an intensive search. It is also interesting when you request the invoice for a transaction: Then you get the message that “the invoice will be sent automatically on the day of the debit”. Of course I checked that and as expected, an invoice never came on the day of the debit ... Only now, at the moment when I requested the invoice, it came to my email account by return post.

Extending the parking time to the minute only works to a limited extent, so in the app yes, but there are big leaps in terms of costs, which are ALWAYS more expensive than inserting coins. Despite the inside window sticker and paid parking time, a parking attendant also wanted to issue a parking ticket, which I saw in time. When I referred to the sticker, he just shrugged my shoulders ... so when parking time is activated, the app also says that you should put a note in the car ... then what is the inside window sticker good for?O.k., if you don't have any change at hand, then the app may make sense, therefore 2 stars, otherwise I recommend change, firstly it is generally cheaper and secondly you avoid misunderstandings with the park attendants.The app would be REALLY useful, among other things, only if it would charge correspondingly little, especially for short-term parking of e.g. 10 minutes, and not even charge more than you have to pay for half an hour by inserting a coin.",2,2016-01-22,5.2,0.9676,,5059,positive

No one there who takes / is responsible for errors on the app. They actually seemed totally uninterested in inquiries about errors on the app. I see in the comments here that I am far from the only one who gets a parking ticket after paying with the Easypark app.,1,2016-04-08,5.4,-0.4215,,8084,neutral

If there is any ""hidden"", illogical or unintuitive way to end parking that I was not made aware of in advance (as other 1-star reviewers here point out), then it is again just bad design in their app. Users can not read developers' thoughts.  —-  The app confirmed 2 TIMES that I have demanded parking from 12:15 to 12:30 and then to 12:45, still I was fined NOK 600 because the parking was closed by itself at. 12.25, have no idea why… I simply feel cheated!

Only the hub is so jargon that every sensible person should stay away. Change the name to ""Park at your own risk"" And when you talk to support, they will not understand that something is wrong.

Again, the developer rejects everything as a user error.  I myself immediately contacted customer service when the app notified me that my parking was about to expire - several days after I had purchased a 24-hour parking. But here I could thank myself. The developer maintains that I as a user must understand that active 24-hour parking does not appear on the app's opening page, as other parking does, and that the user must orient themselves in the submenus, find out if Easypark has charged the user for more than one day, and then take contact customer service before the first 24 hours have passed.

One thing I think could have been an improvement is this with the choice of car and registration number. Here it is very easy to make mistakes as a user, which for me and many others has resulted in a fine - despite the fact that you have actually paid, but for a registration number that does not exist or a car that was obviously not in the parking lot. One idea could be to have a two-step registration of car numbers, so that it is easier to detect errors in registration if these two do not match. Or possibly a check against a register, which means that the registration number that does not exist is not approved by the app, and checks if the first two letters are in the registration number at all. Personally, I missed ""f"" and pressed ""r"" in a hurry - and ""NR"" does not exist. But the cure was there, because this was my fault, which I agree with! (Despite the fact that I think the parking attendant should have looked for the car he had paid for, and not found this, and then looked between his fingers and thought ""here is someone who has been human to misprint in the app"".) By improving it I have mentioned above, I think the app would be more ""foolproof"" and even more would have enjoyed and trusted the app, and that parking attendants do not have to take the brunt of the user's mistakes - which is often awkward to admit as a user :)",3,2019-03-03,12.6,0.9737,,8609,positive

The parking code of 3 or four digits are prone to mistakes in typing and complaining to easypark does not help as they are not the one renting out the parking lot. Easypark is not interested to improve the app as Europark makes more money with errors of the user. Strongly recommend to write these complaints so that the app gets improved. Parking lot codes should not be very similar. I had to type 9445 (Sandnes) but easypark app registered 944, which was a parking lot in Oslo.  Called immediately when I saw the fine in the window of my car. Everybody makes typing errors on the mobilphone. The software should be better and only a numeric keyboard should be given (similar when I use the Bank ID on my phone) to reduce the change on typing errors.  Finally do not use this app. Please boycot it until improved. My comments to Easyparc should be valued the 600kr fine!!  The answer of Easyparc is that they all have 4 digit codes. I am 100% sure that I did not type 0944. How can then 944 be written on the historic confirmation of my payment. See for yourself!

Put the car in a time-limited period (because you do not want it on your list) called rental car (or borrowed car). Ask when it is entered which country it is registered in, and verify the sign against this country.

To closely analyze offered tariff group titles or memorize a multi-digit tariff group digit readable but undercommunicated a good distance away at the vending machine, when a location service on a mobile (!)

Also: If you receive a fee, even though it is registered in the system that the car is legally parked, it is easier to complain about incorrectly charged fees.

It does not allow confirmation of parking, so if a mistake is made, either by the user or by the application, there is no going back.

It is possible that I am stupid, as they came to suggest, but as I see from the opinions, there are many of us. It is possible that the application is only for gifted people, so I will unsubscribe as soon as the claim that I have filed with the City Council is resolved.

I understand that the city council can set some rules, but if so, then EasyPark should change the current design of the payment mode (at least in Madrid, put separate buttons for selecting time and payment) so that it is not so easy to make the mistake to pay for a parking that you do not want to do or for the unwanted time.

To top it off, there is no confirm parking button, so if you get lost, you can pay for parking involuntarily as it happened to me. In short, I can't think of any reason to keep using it.
