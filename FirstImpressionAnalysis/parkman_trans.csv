Henri;BUGINEN! This was so awkward to make that work! Required 5 text with verification codes and ID password reset on top to get ahead. Of course, the problems did not stay there, but the terms had to be accepted about 10 times to get open. The right of the location also had to be manually turned on to turn on the settings. When these were ok, I couldn't even put it in the park the next morning due to the 4h limit. Fortunately, there was extra time to adjust, and eventually EasyPark opened and had the car parked.;2;2021-07-13;5.34

For example, on Monday I parked and on Thursday I will come back in a glass 3x50 ‚Ç¨ fine and transfer request.

Millariina V;There was an advertisement for the application on the ATM: First parking is free with a code. I didn‚Äôt have any coins, so I downloaded the app to take advantage of the offer. After installation, it turned out that the app could not be used until the billboard arrived in the mail and I glued it to the windshield. So you didn't get free parking right away. The car was borrowed from a friend, so the sticker can‚Äôt be glued anyway without asking. In addition, the parking time started immediately by accident, which means that free parking was wasted.;1;2016-06-19;3.21

Jouni Aho;Currently version 3.16 and it works and I use and I am almost happy. At some point in the updates, the choice of parking time became the choice of end time to the nearest hour and minute. In the old one, only the length of the parking time from this moment onwards was chosen x hours / minutes. AND IT WAS CONVENIENT! Now you have to look at what the clock is and adjust the end time hours and minutes separately. May be suitable for rapper fans but not for me. When this change came, I immediately sent feedback and suggested that you could choose which feature to use from the menu. There was a green light that this could be done - sometimes. Not done yet! Convenient app by the way, but only 3 stars due to the rapping of the P-time expiration time! * * * Application startup is interrupted by a message stating that the process com.neligrate.parkman stopped unexpectedly. Reinstallation and booting your phone between installation attempts and application removals will not help. Samsung Xcover GT-S5690 and Android version 2.3.6.

TwoDolphins;Starting parking is easy, but for the duration you would like at least a 90 minute option, maybe others. We would also like a calculation of the price of parking already when parking. The reminder to end parking when returning to the car based on GPS positioning does not work in practice. Also, the fact that terminating parking requires two consecutive presses is annoying: e.g., the slide switch would work better if you want to avoid erroneous presses.;3;2019-01-28 16:48:12;3.56

That is, if you park with Parkman in a foreign city, you still have to get out of the car and look for a parking meter to find out what is in question. the correct name of the parking area to make sure the app has actually located you in the right place.

Riikka_;I don‚Äôt use parking coins anymore when Parkman is so convenient. But I would like such a development that if the paid max 2h parking time in the morning starts at 8 am, then I would be able to install parking time there in the evening for the time between 8-10 am. Slot machines do this, but Parkman doesn't.;4;2015-06-10 08:14:04;2.8.1

That is, if you meet at the gym for a couple of hours and the parking fee expires in the area within an hour then you will have to suspend activities so you can stop the parking fee from running out.

I arrived at the parking lot at night, when there was free parking on the meter until eight, but I thought I would sleep a couple of hours longer. I then stabbed the machine, and at night when I got off when paid parking would start. I stabbed the watch for a couple of hours.;;;

Mika Pirhonen;Easy and cheap parking most locations on Finland üá´üáÆ. Most cities use this and private parking spot. Europark AutoPay locations you can use Parkman, license plate regonition is key. Also some AimoPark & Pasilan Pys√§k√∂inti, Port of Helsinki locations. Start parking on app when parked, just check you are right area. Payment works with Visa / Mastercard card, collecting happens next month 1.st day. Pay just time you need, and extend if you need. ...

Mattias Andersson;When you decide to park, they change the parking fee + their profit, so for instance I park for 1 hour and the parking fee was 4 Euro, they charge 4.50 euro. That is okay. But then if you take a moment (seconds) to decide, then they increase their fee, to make you feel stressed to park. So suddenly the parking + fee was 4.65 euro and as I thought, shall I pay for 1 or 2 hours? Their fee increased over time. So when I paid, they wanted 4.75 euro. For me this is annoying. Take another app.;2;2021-09-04;nan

Vilhelm Milis;Good app that's easy to use, but is missing one feature that would make it great, it should show nearby parking spaces and the prices next to them, because how it is now, you only know the price of parking once you are in the parking lot and you have to find a parking space by yourself, instead of choosing one from the app. Another feature would be nice of being able to schedule parking to start at a later time for parking spots that have set times that you need to pay for.;3;2021-06-03;5.31

Even though ParkMan takes 10% plus 35 cents, I think this will be saved by only paying for the exact time parked, rather than having to add a safety margin - well done!

Michal Brutvan;Great app, makes parking very easy. However, after I got a new phone and installed Parkman on it, I did not realize I had two cars in it after logging in, and the app did not ask me which car I'd like to park with. It somehow determined the car automatically, which was incidentally not the car I parked with. So on top of my 20 euro parking bill, I ended up with an 80 euro fine too. I'd say that's a very expensive UX issue.;4;2019-10-08;4.87

The app also does not support Android multi-window function, so you can not ""pin"" the photo of your license plate while entering in the app. These are not advanced features, these are quite basic things that every Android developer encounters in the first book on Android development.

Jani Nuutinen;I left the car on the shore of Kaivopuisto and went on a cruise. The app worked just fine, but I would have missed more clearly information on whether to keep the app on the trip and whether leaving the country affects operations, etc. But it worked well, the meter slapped nicely on the cell phone in the background. One star off because the app charges a parking fee for a longer period of time in an area where the charge ends at 6pm, not 9pm as in the app‚Äôs data.;4;2015-11-02;3.15

Think I use 3rd party parking radar app until then.;5;2014-11-06;2.95
Christian M√∏ller;The new app is ingenious. Instead of just showing the current hourly rate, it makes an estimate of the total cost of parking. It also shows prices for surrounding parking spaces so you can easily find the cheapest.

The challenge with the app is to remember to turn it off when driving from the parking lot. In Frederiksberg, you must know that there is 2 hours of free parking - because the app snatches a day pass for 35 kroner as soon as it is activated.;4;2014-02-27 22:00:10;2.5.2

furzer4ever;easy to use without a doubt, but they have to earn money on all the times you forget to turn off the parking and in that way it costs far more than parking fines. if they can locate one's position via gps, parking should automatically stop when the gps location moves, so that one does not feel cheated every time one forgets to turn off the street parking.;3;2013-05-08 12:12:32;2.05

HuntieDK;It is so much cooler to use ParkMan than EasyPark (I use it in Copenhagen). No monthly subscription, and the GPS finds the place, so you do not have to enter the area number.;5;2012-08-07 07:58:12;1.12
Claus Krogsgaard;Good app. Work as it should and you calculate exactly how long you need to park.;5;2012-06-09 22:40:59;1.12
Birkb√∏ll;It has made it so much easier to park. The app works really well. The creation was easy and the functionality itself works optimally. Incredibly light and user-friendly app.;5;2012-05-23 06:30:18;1.10
