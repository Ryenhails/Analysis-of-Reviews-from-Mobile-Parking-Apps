6;Nicolas Dupin;Little interest in the application: Geolocation works poorly, pay attention to the area code when you park. Impossible to extend the parking time, which could have been the only interest of the application. Service charges that increase the cost of parking by 30% compared to paying at the terminal. Lots of points to improve.;1;2021-08-21;15.25.0;0.8445;positive

34;BEAL Jacqueline;Product which lacks success, the designer has certainly never had to extend his parking lot because the procedure has to be redone and above all to re-register the parking space when of course we are no longer nearby.

65;Tom Ramel;Bugged application which no longer displays the current rights ... Obliged to go through the website. Already that to impose a private service provider to manage its parking subscriptions is very limited on the part of the city of Bordeaux ... The minimum is that the tool works. Especially considering the racket that one suffers in the event of a fine. Besides, warn 1 week in advance of the end of your subscription and not on D-Day, it's extremely petty!;1;2021-06-27;15.23.0;-0.865;negative

91;Michel Szczesny;Nothing to complain about for short-term parking: the app does the job. For residential parking there is a lack of transparency concerning the extensions to take into account public holidays or in the event of confinement: this appears in the rights under a reason "Extension" without being notified so we find each other easily to pay for nothing, as I just did (I only understood this by going to Effia);2;2021-05-16;15.20.0;0.5283;positive
92;Laurent FELIN;Well, I wouldn't say that I take pleasure in paying for my parking, but it is true that this application is well designed. This allows you to walk with a light mind and to be able to extend your parking distance if necessary. Nevertheless I would not put 5 stars because the invoicing of the sending of a proof by email or then of an SMS alert, it is still a little abused. In addition, it necessarily works only in places where there is a data network.;3;2021-05-13;15.20.0;0.8438;positive

401;Daniel Delacour;Hello, I have been using your app for a long time with no problems so far. I parked at 2:31 pm in the city center which offers 15 free minutes. I accepted them and started my clock until 4:30 p.m. When returning to my vehicle I found a fine of 25 ‚Ç¨ for unpaid parking. At no time was I informed that the clock stops after the 15 free minutes. (14:46) We should not be able to turn the wheel to go to the desired time. I made a complaint to the town hall of my city which refused my request. I am therefore obliged to pay when I was in good faith. Can you do a little business gesture? On the other hand, in my city parking is free from 12 p.m. to 2 p.m. I have noticed several times that it was not possible to switch on from 2 p.m. if you arrive before (eg I go to the sport at 2 p.m., so I have to park from 2.45 p.m. and I pay the 1 / 4 of an hour when it should be free.

502;Serge Moreno;the practical side you can pay without being in front of a terminal, hence the star. the negative side ... no free end of parking warning (it's expensive 0.15 cts to send a text). erratum: there is indeed a visual warning, but it disappears quickly, and if you have the phone in your pocket, no sound. one afternoon in Bordeaux missed 2 warnings, fortunately the asvp did not pass in the area.;1;2019-02-15;12.5;-0.946;negative

747;christophe bottier;In Bordeaux it's a disaster! Give us the Urbis app! 1- URBIS sent us a FREE SMS notification when we arrived towards the end of the parking period. This service has become chargeable on Easy Park. 2- On URBIS it was easy to extend a parking lot already in progress. On Easy park impossible. And if it is still doable and much better, but the ergonomics of the application are so bad that I did not find it. Suddenly obliged to start a new parking lot but you have to enter your parking zone ... I do not know it because I use geo-localization .... and afterwards inevitably I am no longer next to my car when I have to extend the parking time. Beginning of trouble ...... 3- I cannot find the current balance of my account on the application, whereas on Urbis it was very simple. 4- I noticed that my credit card number is in my Easy Park account data even though I had not authorized Urbis to automatically top up my account and therefore I entered my credit card number each time I top up. Who authorized you to recover my credit card number? 5 - On Urbis at the end of the parking we received a free SMS indicating the amount of parking and the balance of our account.

I was supposed to relax in town and I didn't not ceased to be disturbed by the application.As a result, I only managed to pay from 3:20 p.m. to 3:28 p.m. and from 3:38 p.m. to 3:51 p.m. ... incomprehensible I could not add extra time to my parking lot because it was supposedly already underway.

1060;mahela;Already the name, you had to dare when you see how difficult it is to make this new application work ...The previous one (URBISMOBILE), was not easy to use, had computer malfunctions of which we were not aware, interlocutors, difficult to reach at the other end of France ... this one is worse !Why this change? In whose interest?Today, I was punctured 4 times (resident rate one day)!Of course, to have an interlocutor to give us explanations or help, it is almost impossible, which is not normal. To verbalize, on the other hand, they are very present and very reactive!On my purchase history: only one date of parking appears, whereas almost daily parking has been purchased since the change of application and therefore the change of the (private?) Company in charge of managing paid parking in Bordeaux.How to navigate?What about the jackpot I had on my old application, since I had to make the advance? Nothing was returned to me at this day...Faced with this new consequent tax, disguised as a "resident rate" and having been sold to us as in front of us facilitating the parking in the district whereas it is even more difficult to put our 4 wheels near our residence since it is paying (installation of low poles, etc.)It is a vast swindle of those who cannot afford to park in their homes.Of course, no email is mentioned on the application for complaints or phone number for requests for help in case of need.As for the end of parking alert, now chargeable, it is scandalous.I will not dwell on the fact that the street which extends ours is not in the same charging zone and therefore, is at the maximum rate if we cannot find a place in our block or beyond. This is all maddening!I have a proposal to make: a single zone for all Bordeaux residents (and therefore Bordeaux taxpayers, already heavily taxed), identified by a sticker on the windshield, with free parking for one vehicle per dwelling.What do you think of all this?;1;2017-08-02;5.8.9;-0.8907;negative

Perhaps I'm too cynical, but little pieces of paper of the kind "trust me, I did pay" don't tend to work and you get a little piece of paper with a fine instead.

1253;Aaron Jobsz;App is not intuitive. Wheel is a annoying and no option for full day, have to spin the way through. Last step to 're-confirm' vehicle at end, means a slip of the finger and you choose the wrong vehicle, and then get fined for not having parking. When you choose the vehicle at the beginning, you should not be forced to choose the vehicle again as the last step, with no confirm if the vehicle has changed.;1;2021-07-06;15.23.0;-0.7731;negative

Using the GPS, if it cannot find on its system a 'parking area' it will not let you pay for parking, EVEN IF YOU ARE ALREADY IN A DESIGNATED PARKING SPACE. It only says 'no parking area found' and won't allow payment even when unlimited spaces are available. After my initial review I received comments from the developer so I went out SPECIFICALLY TO TEST THE APP AGAIN. I parked in a designated parking space - TWICE. On both occasions the app showed 'no parking area found' - as was shown with screenshots. Also shown were the photos taken within seconds of those screenshots showing available parking. Easy-Park took over e-Park, which always worked without difficulty, (also took over my credit with them). . . and now I have this flawed app instead.

While i was talking to costumer service, the money i paid were sent back directly. Costumer service said that the problem is not theirs and that i have to pay the fee. Now costumer service doesn't answer to my emails anymore. I DON'T RECOMMEND IT AT ALL;1;2020-11-15;15.13.1;-0.9071;negative

1453;Henrik Kirk;Why is notifications not turned on by default. Seem like a way to make sure you forget at least one parking.. And what should it help to contact customer service?

I parked at a 10h metre, dialed in 4h and when I returned in 3h I had a ticket, checked the app and it had changed me to a different code metre that only allowed 1h, those metres were on the other side of the road.

1967;Niko laj;Got a fine because the app chose a wrong zone. This was despite the correct gps position. Can see from the answer from the developer that I should have elaborated this. I park 1-3 times a week in vognmagergade in KBH. I always arrive early to get that seat with the least chance of car dents. When I used the parkman, it always found my position fairly quickly, but after the switch to easypark, it can take 10-20 seconds more. I always keep an eye on it finding the carmaker's street, because it may well place one on one of the streets next to it, but it is in the same zone (red). A little bit thin to blame the GPS as it obviously works fine with the parkman. Is forced to use easypark, because the company I work for has chosen to use it, and what is with it is easier than sitting and messing with vouchers in hand and spending money yourself.;1;2019-03-11;12.6;0.5761;positive

2013;iLhaN SeN;The interface is quite user friendly and good looking. The low rate is because of lack of activity in notification panel during an active parking. Believe developers wanted to do so on purpose (to let people easily forget and pay more than necessary). Another similar parking system and its dedicated app has that function and it is a must for a such application which means cost for user/customer.

For example in Park.me you start a parking process by press and hold for 3 seconds to not accidentally start or stop you parking, here you just tap. I accidentally stopped my parking prosses during unlocking phone with app open. But the absolute worst ist the background power consumption! It uses more power that Instagram and Facebook together by just sitting on the background on your locked phone.

And when you scroll, it flashes very briefly, but disappears again: The area in which the map should be is then simply white and otherwise empty. It often works, for example, when I go to Settings (the map is then grayed out in the background) and back again. But it is not a guarantee: most of the time the card remains visible, but often enough it disappears again. Unfortunately, it is quite difficult to use, so I can get annoyed with parking meters again.;2;2018-12-09;12.0;-0.9643;negative
2037;Matija ≈Ωerdin;What I do like: ability to pay without actual use of cash and to renew parking from a distance. What I don't like: 1) minute dial is cumbersome and useless, since you will pay the full hour amount for anything between 1 minute and 1 hour. Either change to 1 hour intervals wihout the dial button, or interpolate price to 10 minute intervals, as the paper bills allow already. Or do both. 2) design suggestion: when you authorise payment, actively ask which car you want to pay for. Current design keeps the last parked car as default, therefore I got a parking fine a few times because I didn't notice I had chosen the wrong car. 3) design suggestion: allow for more than one simultaneous parking from the same app. E.g. If I want to pay for my wife, a friend or other member of my family. Current design does not allow it. I liked the previous app much better.;2;2018-12-06;12.0;0.837;positive

I found out later the parking had expired 15 min earlier 3) for some reason the max parking time has been limited to 2h. It is impossible to set the timer to longer period. You have to stop the timer or let the time expire and start a new parking. So what happens if I'm at the cinema when the 2h expire (this happened to me yesterday) and I am unable start a new parking with the app? Does Easypark pay my parking ticket if I get one?!

Do not believe in the developer who has explained to me that this must be the case. It should not be so difficult to find out if, for example, it has been restarted since the last start-up. Or maybe I should sniff the network traffic to see what you're actually doing? Update October 1st. 2017. The problem is still there. Installed again then to see if the problem was gone.

However, once run, it remains active and consumes battery at an alarming rate (even when my parking has expired and there's no sane reason for it to remain active).   Force stopping the app after parking saves my battery, but it's an annoyance. Once that's fixed, I would rate it at three stars: higher, if the rather ugly non-Material UI is cleaned up.;2;2016-08-16;5.6;-0.5574;negative

2658;Salvatore Sanfilippo;The app used to be very convenient, but now they read the location in background turning the app into a battery killer. The idea of adding this feature without a way to turn the feature off was terrible: I spend several tens of euros every month in parking fees using this app, I expected more care on their side. While we are at it, the app user experience is pretty terrible... It is quite obvious that most people often park in the same zone with the same car, but no help from the app about this.  EDIT: Thanks for the reply EasyPark team. Much better with the update that let me disable the position tracking, however this should be the default, many will notice the battery drain, but only a few will check the settings and will deinstall: you may lose customers IMHO. About the setting to save the last area/car, great, but good UI should not me require to check under settings for such a feature, should hint me directly the right thing in my view. However because of the setting to disable position tracking and the ability to enable save zone/car, I upgraded my rating from 2 to 3 stars. Thanks.;3;2015-05-18;4.7;0.9718;positive

2682;Trax Swe;In Sweden it's as follows, 1) minimum 5sek extra fee to park (or if you miss the time running out and have to renew it). 2) remainder that is listed under features is not a simple thing as a buzz or sound, no its a sms. Meaning it costs extra to have enabled. So it's very easy to miss it and your time expires. 3) An electronic free digital pdf with the receipt sent over email costs extra.

The app hangs, does not log in, or loses contact with the "server". Check my connection with ookla, among other things, directly when it happens and I have always had full 4G when it happens. Sometimes my car disappears from the list and every other time an ongoing parking has disappeared or I have not been able to start parking! Have had to close the app, open it again and repeat this procedure maybe 4-5 times before the parking is visible and I can finish or start it. Compared to the SMS Park app, this is a joke! When I moved from SMS Park to this new one, I also received a warning. "The format of your registration number does not match the standard format of your region / country" or something like that.

2949;Erkkii;The opposite of respect for the customer. Takes at least 15% surcharge on each invoice for, according to its own statement, so-called "Innovative parking solutions". What is innovative with a white painted window on asphalt can of course be discussed. How each invoice completely sonic can also get a mandatory half-hidden surcharge cost of 15% in retrospect instead of the cost of the parking itself (the one you as a customer see) also feels worth thinking about. It is also worth noting how this unavoidable surcharge is also stated to amount to a minimum of SEK 5 - ie. in many cases, perhaps closer to 50% of the invoice cost for, for example, those who park for a shorter period of time or in less expensive parking spaces. The company offers very few payment solutions, no e-invoice and charges the above fee, in addition to the parking fee, regardless of payment method. If you fail to opt out of a paper invoice, you have a SEK 25 distribution fee (quite juicy even that for a parking fee of SEK 8). It would be nice to be able to choose another company to park at, but now parking spaces do not work that way‚Ä¶;1;2021-09-10;15.26.0;0.6522;positive

But maybe it's "by design" in this app? Update after response from EasyPark: what do you mean I should contact you if I need help? Instead of writing the same standard answer to everyone, you should instead take seriously that you almost only get one star out of everyone who leaves feedback here.

Another thing is that I expected Easy Park to match Parkster's functionality (if the municipality did a good job in procurement), unfortunately it turned out that Easy Park has no function to choose the date when my housing ticket will take effect but assumes that I want DateTime.Now () so now I lose one day and SEK 70 in value, fun - thanks for that!;2;2021-02-14;15.16.0;0.9737;positive

Scarce and hard-to-find information, the app refers to the website's home page instead of taking one to what you are looking for. Everything is designed to make it as difficult as possible for users so that Easy Park can charge as much as possible and write as many parking fines as possible.

3200;thadvnt79;Used EasyPark's GPS positioning to find the parking lot. After the app identified exactly where I stood, I started parking. This resulted in a fine as EasyPark had marked the wrong tariff / code. They take no responsibility at all for this. I'm far from the only one who has been affected. Feel free to read other reviews and other users' experience of EasyPark on e.g. trustpilot. I see that I have received an answer from the app developer. You should be extremely aware that the information presented in the app is not as simple as the app manufacturer wants it to appear. Also, do not forget that EasyPark makes its money regardless of whether you as a user are fined or not. But that says something about a parking company whose vision is to improve "the Urban Experince" instead of having the vision to help users easily park correctly and ensure that parking fines are avoided. I want to claim that EasyPark's GPS function helps to do the opposite and there are several reviews here from people who have experienced the same thing as me. In addition, the name of the app contributes to the problem, as it is promised to be simple, but in comparison with other services, it is the direct opposite. After further answers from where you claim that you want to try to help your customers as best as possible, the statement remains that you fail with it quite often (by the way, still looking for the Gallup survey that you refer to on your website regarding customer satisfaction). And ang. If I have been in contact with your customer service, yes of course I have. At first glance, it looks like a professional answer, but for anyone who has parked at some point and then been fined, I dare say that your answer is perceived as extremely condescending. For those of you who read this review, really take a look at other people's reviews also regarding EasyPark and its app and think about whether there might not be a better alternative when you park. (For example, a company that also takes care of the fine and in this way actually has a much greater responsibility and thus better opportunities to really help parking customers than a company like EasyPark).

3323;IngelaOl;Completely hopeless app. The car's position on the map is never correct! I have to enter the area code every time, because I try to print on the map, so there is no parking where I stand. Remove the map then! When I want to extend the time, the parking is interrupted and I have to start all over again. There is no info that I have to manually change country, although the map shows that I am in another country. I do not think I am technically stupid in ordinary cases, but this app makes me feel stupid in my head. From now on, I will use the parking meter instead.;1;2018-08-03;11.1;-0.8993;negative

Apparently took over someone else's number when I was covering the new subscription. Poor security if it is enough to enter the number to log in if the number has already been registered to someone else before. You can contact the support yourself as it is a security risk.

3403;iYlva;I stand in the same entrance parking the times I park with the easypark app. Many new updates have made it better. A big disadvantage is that after you have started your parking, it is at least as easy to accidentally end it. I did. It cost me SEK 750. I am moody. In the app, you end the parking at the exact same place where you start it. You do not need to confirm that you want to end the parking elsewhere on the screen. The app may be nicer in that way, but for me it meant that after I had started the parking, I ran towards the train, threw the phone in my pocket. There in my pocket I happened to finish my parking. Unintentionally. Now the next time I parked, I checked lots of times that the parking is running. An alternative to avoid these mistakes is to close the app. But the backbone feeling says no. What happens when you shut down Netflix or Spotify ... well the movie or music ends. It's a bit the same feeling to shut down the app. What makes me feel safe with my parking not closing? There are things to improve here to avoid these mistakes. I'm not impressed because a SEK 20 parking lot cost me a fine of SEK 750 when all I wanted was to do the right thing for me. Improve the app so that you do not accidentally interrupt your parking.;1;2017-12-20;10.2;0.8492;positive

3434;Obban47;The possibility to add your own favorites is gone. You must find one marked on the map to add as a favorite, memorize the zone number or check the history. All the pieces are time consuming. All old favorites disappeared in o with the update. 2. The new scroll wheel is discarded. Reminiscent of the scroll wheel on an old Philips TV remote.While extending / selecting a time, you may start or stop a time. Scrolling takes unnecessary time from the user who sets a time longer than 20 minutes. The alternative timeout interface is gone.3. All text about registration number and location clumps together under the scroll wheel when you have started your time (iPhone 5S).4. The app is tougher than the old version. Purely subjectively, it feels like it consumes more battery as well. I can not understand why the EP thinks this version is a worthy successor. Do it again and do it right. With the frustration that the new version has created, I learn to find a worthy competitor asap. The old version was almost perfect.;2;2017-12-02;10.0.3;0.9536;positive
3439;Resgust;Use this and several similar daily. Above all, it lacks two functions that are no longer available, or no longer work, as well as views on the spinning wheel. 1) The possibility that the app itself shows the area code, this has existed in previous versions but no longer works and now I have to go to the machine to replace the area code and manually enter this in the app. 2) The app's icon does not show ongoing parking. This is found in all other P-apps I use, e.g. SMS Park, Park in Gothenburg, Parkster and others. This has also existed here before, I want to remember as I am now disturbed by the fact that it does not exist. 3) The time setting, the spinning wheel, you get crazy about if you have to park for a long time, e.g. night parking as it may need to spin 15 laps to get the desired time. Look at how "Park in Gothenburg" has solved this for inspiration. Otherwise, thanks for a good app that got worse at point 1 & 2;3;2017-11-30;10.0.3;0.6059;positive

What is the point of that if you still get the opportunity to finish the parking when you are done.You must also enter the region code, which means that you must find a parking meter to read the code.I am very disappointed mainly with the companies / municipalities that hire incompetent app developers or suppliers.On the plus side, I can mention push notifications for when the parking time is running out, which would not be needed at all as you did not have to enter the parking time in advance.;1;2016-12-26;5.8.3;-0.5708;negative

3553;1miffo;Since installation a year ago, I have used EasyPark many times without any problems. If there is a queue at the ticket machine, it does not matter, you just take the area number, enter it while leaving, select the vehicle you are going to park, spin on the time wheel, press start, of course. If you need more time and it is possible to extend, you can during the meeting, lunch or whatever you do extend the time by just starting the app and spinning the wheel and if you come tbx before the time runs out you can cancel the parking and in this way you pay only for the time you stand there.

3587;Andos716;I tested this app a number of years ago because I like the concept. However, I did not manage to create a working account so I quit immediately. Now I was recommended that it works well so I refueled it and tried to use it. My opinion is that it is completely inconceivable that the service still exists. You are met by a message that the user does not exist and that you should call the support, which of course is not open on the weekend. Sigh. Ok I log in to their website and try to create a user but after entering all my information and pressing save nothing happens. Test again and same thing. Incredible. This is probably the worst app / service I have ever tested and that you also seem to charge for a pdf receipt and have a surcharge on the parking lot is under all criticism.

When users receive fines even though they have demonstrably paid with the app, then the TOTAL SERVICE DOES NOT WORK. And everything else is just what is important to the user.

In addition, the license plate entry could be more intelligent, I typed my number plate with the spaces it has and was told that it was the wrong format. The company's P sign also does not clearly say that you can park for free for a period, some locals had to tell me this. On the sign, parking is allowed with a parking disc for a maximum of two hours, parking for a fee for a maximum of two hours. What the hell does that mean?

4100;tommyandersendk;Hey Easypark, Happy user of your app, but have a wish for improvement: In the menu item My Parking under History, you get a list sorted by Day, and you can see the Zone, Time Period and the Car's Number Plate, but unfortunately not the amount that the parking has cost. I get my parking fees refunded and it is very hassle to have to go into the details of the individual parking to find a certain amount in the overview. Could you not add the P-amount to the overview - possibly. just in the line just after the time period (or on a separate line)?

I contact Easypark and am informed that it is my own responsibility to check that the app has registered the car's location correctly, which it basically is, but after using Parkman for three years and never experiencing any problems, it's not part of my routine to double check.

Instead of just adding my card, I now have to subscribe (never in life) and even worse then I will get an invoice to be paid every month. If you have ever worked in a large company, you know that as an employee you do NOT want an invoice that takes months to get paid, you want to pay with your card because it is efficient.So all in all, it was a finding that:-EasyPark does not think about the customer but about their own wishes- EasyPark should change the name, there is NOTHING easy about their app- The Parkman app is necessary if you want two profiles- EasyPark should be ‚Äòdisrupted‚Äô by someone who can deliver a smart product, and then they are out of the market in 2-3 years.

4157;Btotheone;I have had a very unfortunate experience with the app‚Äôs registration of the location, which resulted in my parking time starting in the wrong zone and thus a parking ticket. The speed of the registration of which zone you are in, and the ease of use in that you become aware of a possible incorrect registration while you are on the go, I consider to be extremely poor compared to other parking apps. In that case, there was no question that I had left the car or that I had otherwise made a remote registration. It was just that the app had not managed to register my location correctly (despite the fact that I always give it some time when I open the app) and that I was not aware that it had not registered it correctly. The parking ticket was my mistake and therefore I paid for it, but I definitely think that the app can handle a software update that makes it faster to register the location, as it takes a long time. Again, this is alone compared to other parking apps.In addition, one could consider whether the usability of the app should be updated so that the user can not avoid seeing or getting checked that it is in the wrong zone that is registered.;1;2018-10-24;11.5;-0.7725;negative

It eats itself up in subscriptions and fees.The new app is insanely long to boot and the wheel is miserable to say the least. The old function was better and very important faster in start-up and operation.GPS location is ok smart, however have not really used it.

4270;hvid1;The new app is a school example of a solid and good product that liiiige to be updated by some smart developers. Without adding any new function at all - I can at least not see them - the usability is completely out of control and the app has become totally unusable. The time wheel covers the registration number, the wheel lags, the message text about where to enter the area number is illegible in the dark, the credit card number is partly hidden by the ".... more" button and in general the graphics have taken total dominance over the functionality.

4299;Brain-And;The app works satisfactorily once you have learned to use it and got it set up properly. It has almost become a necessity to use APPs for parking, now that the municipalities have removed most vending machines.I think 15% on top of the parking fee for their APP service is completely unreasonably high Regarding setup which is the main reason why I scored the APP low. It was not intuitive for me to get it set up properly and there are no locks in the system on obvious typos.This meant that I parked illegally many times in the beginning, despite the fact that I paid parking fees to Easypark.It was then discovered when I got an expensive parking fee in the windshield that I naturally could not understand. It was then here that Easy Park could tell me that my registration was incorrect. I had entered the parking area number where my registration number on the car should have been. I can only recommend that you be very careful about getting into the APP, and do not install it in a pressured parking situation.;2;2017-07-25;5.8.9;0.7264;positive

4476;sjeberg;A simple app that is easy to use. It costs no fee if you register as a user via the app. I use it without a subscription and it costs a small fee. However, it is repealed by the fact that I do not have to pay extra time. I do not need to bring coins. I do not have to stand in a smaller queue at a stand. I do not have to wait for an eternity like when I use Dankort. I can steer the parking lot away from the car.

4477;Hanne Klintoe;Very happy with the EasyPark app. Fast, easy, well designed - saves a lot of time not having to fiddle with credit card or cash at the ticket machines.

4479;Idleder;It costs a little extra to park, but this is quickly earned, as you only pay for the exact time you have parked, even if you have extended the time beyond the first set time. This adjustment is easy to make without having to go and buy a new parking ticket. By and large, a gift for the motorist who often has to park in areas covered by EasyPark.;5;2013-10-08;3.3;0.7964;positive
4480;Ravnsbjerg;This app is really good and the flexibility it gives you in changing your parking time is invaluable in my opinion.This also includes stopping your parking if you are back ahead of time so that you only pay for the time you actually park.;5;2013-10-08;3.3;0.5563;positive
4481;Mertner;The mere fact that you can adjust the time without having to return to the car is worth the fee .. that you then also avoid finding suitable coins or spend the night at the parking machine while thinking about your Dankort is only a bonus. The area viewfinder is not accurate enough and the time wheel can be a bit annoying if you want to small-adjust the time, but otherwise very satisfied. And yes, you have to have stickers in the windshield so the parking attendant knows they have to check online.;5;2013-10-05;3.3;0.8585;positive

4643;Swagger jagger;I came across typing the wrong registration number and can now not be allowed to change it again. So what I am left with is an app where I can park a car other than my own.

4644;Tommie AppleID;In my experience, the features the app offers work flawlessly.

4658;Rune J√∏rgensen;This app is the purest shit, I do not even bother to waste more time on it by elaborating.

4660;JoJ√∏rg;Completely agree with the attitude of the others. Nowhere is it made known that it costs 39 a month. Peasant trapping. Horse dealers.

4671;Mien2;Why do you have to pay extra money for parking with this app? And why does i not say that you have to, and how much? (DKK 39.- every month!!!)Why does it not use the GPS location service to find out where you are?Why does it redirect you to a call to some service desk when you want to get a member? That's very odd! No! that's a no-go for me! Please correct this:- Ability to use the app without paying extra money.- Location via GPS so you don't need to enter any location code.- Simple registration and permanent loggin.;1;2012-02-09;1.1;0.6168;positive
4672;Karstansan;The app gives a really good overview of ongoing parking - as well as in relation to using car no. 1 or 2. BUT as others mention, the GPS connection would be the most optimal addon! Until then - can you not add the texts to the numbers in the overview? P.t. You have to run around with the small note indicating translation from numbers to area. When you use the phone solution, the digital voice reads a confirmation in which area you are holding - good assurance that you have not typed incorrectly - This security is not present in the app and that is a big minus!;3;2012-02-08;1.1;0.9659;positive
4677;Ice cream van;downloaded this app, and expected from the description on the parking meter quick hassle-free registration.instead, it calls for a perpetually busy customer service that initially misleads. the second time you are then told that you have to sign up and pay monster fee and blah blah blah. money machine = no thank you. in advance it is damn expensive to park in kbh.;1;2011-12-17;1.1;-0.7514;negative

4681;Hanne Bolander;Bold APP, fat to get rid of cards and coins, mega nice to be able to side to meeting and just extend his parking and thereby get rid of a parking fee. It's just as cool to be able to stop your parking ahead of time .... I am aware that sometimes it can take some time before I receive a message that the parking has been stopped but that is probably because the phone just needs to be connected to the web. Self.

4690;Zaqaz;I can only agree with the other comments. The app is super, but it is obvious to use gps to determine / suggest the area code. Moreover, it can probably not be so difficult to provide a search option to find area codes based on city, provider (parking kbh, europark, etc.) or the like.

4697;qudsgn;I've found the app very useful for years. The UI was successful, it already worked great on my 5s and that is also the case with the 8. The learning curve is extremely fast. Thanks for your coloring. I hate blue apps. Germans are afraid of color. You are a great exception. But seriously: changing the phone number is impossible. This does not have to be solved in the app. But I should be able to edit my account on the website. I can't make the entrepreneur app appealing to my boss. The payment methods are not sufficiently explained for my boss. He has no desire to read a body of text. I'd rather submit the parking garage receipt. A table helps. In my opinion, your marketing has some catching up to do.;5;2018-02-17;10.3.1;0.872;positive
4698;M Kaffee;I use EasyPark regularly and see this app as a great asset. I finally don't have to search forever for parking machines and change. It is particularly good that I can stop the parking process when I leave. This up-to-the-minute billing saves me a lot of money, because in the past I always put too much in the parking meter compared to the numbers today so that it just wouldn't expire. I wouldn't have thought, but it pays off well despite the commission due to Easy Park per process. It's great that it can now also be operated using an Apple Watch.;5;2018-04-09;10.5;0.9505;positive
4699;ankn99;I have now been a very long-time user of EasyPark. What I found good with the old app and sorely missed in the new one, nowhere can I see when I have logged in.It would be extremely useful to see when you have logged in under the Active Parking Processes submenu.Also on the main screen, because the down counting counter plus the end time is mocked twice. otherwise the app is easy to use.;5;2018-01-11;10.2;0.8016;positive
4700;smoe68;I usually used the app to pay parking fees in the parking lot at work. (Large car park with very few ticket machines and therefore very long walking distances)However, I have now come across a parking lot where you should either put a "Mobile phone parking" note or a vignette in the vehicle.The app offers to send the vignette, so I thought "why not?"The missing address data was briefly added and then came the disillusionment: unfortunately only the fields for surname and first name can be filled out permanently. The fields for the address, the zip code and the city are always emptied, which makes ordering the vignette so obviously impossible ?!It would be nice if this bug was fixed üòâ;4;2021-03-30;15.19.0;-0.7393;negative
4701;stefsen;I've been using the app for a long time, even if I live in an area where there is little parking management that is supported. Of course, this makes parking a little more expensive, but the simple cashless operation makes up for it.Today I used the CarPlay version for the first time. Well done. Other providers of apps that can be used in the car can learn a bit from this.Keep it up!;5;2021-03-18;15.17.1;0.5562;positive
4704;Grindergrinder;Great thing! Very practical and easy. It's great that it supports Carplay. If it were a little cheaper and you didn't have to tell the parking time in advance, I wouldn't use anything else. üëç Only one problem: when I try to activate camera parking, select the payment method and then click on the vehicle settings the next time, the function is deactivated (the box not selected).

4705;egal_0815#;We got to know the app on vacation in Italy! Installation and registration were easy, but the operation was great! No more annoying change and the parking time can be adjusted individually! Either lengthen or shorten as you need it! Therefore it was neither necessary to overpay nor to buy a new parking ticket! The parking attendants check every car online, there were no problems! And every service has its price, but it was worth it!;5;2021-07-28;15.24.0;0.9385;positive
4706;Effde;I've been using the app for years and I'm very satisfied! The functionality is particularly convincing: first enter a flat-rate parking time and then, if necessary - while you are still sitting in the hairdressing chair üòâ - add another buffer to the time. Or - if you are back at the car 38 minutes earlier - to end the parking process early (and thus save parking fees).;5;2018-05-29;10.7;0.8617;positive

4710;Beatziehungsweise;It helps me a lot because I'm out in the field and can save myself the change.

4717;Matth'W;Due to the lack of cash in coins, I installed the app. The first parking process was successful. Something went wrong on the second attempt on Usedom. The parking process has started properly. Then my return was delayed and I wanted to redeem it online. One of the advertised features. In the meantime my phone had logged into the win roaming network. Not only was the assignment to my vehicle lost, worse: it was not possible to create the vehicle again without further ado. The app persistently refused because the format of the license plate did not match the typical country code.Conclusion: not to be used in border regions and abroad. Abroad, anyway, preferably not, because in case of doubt the burden of proof that the fee has been paid must be in the national language. In addition, I am bothered by the arbitrary fees, which vary from municipality to municipality and are sometimes charged with outrageous basic fees.;2;2021-08-23;15.25.0;-0.9486;negative

4722;OlivChr;The app is ingenious: Instead of looking for the parking meter first, then hoping that you have the right change with you and that you estimate the parking time correctly, you can now conveniently set the time in the car and simply adjust it on your smartphone if necessary.

4724;MS.63;This app solves the annoying problem of having to commit to a parking time at the beginning of parking. Now you can simply book generously and cancel the parking process at the end.

Loaded, registered, opened, localized, no parking zone found, parking zone entered manually, cost ‚Ç¨ 0.49 cents more than at the machine. Of course, it makes little sense if you park for half an hour. In addition, there should be a note on the dashboard that says that I am paying with this app. That was all too stupid for me and then I paid directly at the machine. That is typically German, everything here has to be broken down.;2;2019-08-06;13.7;-0.8442;negative

4763;Rene.K;At the beginning I was quite skeptical whether this would work well in the implementation (reality) and whether I would not get a "ticket" after all. The surface of the app is well and neatly structured, the parking zone (code) has always been correctly recognized automatically and operation is intuitive. So far everything works perfectly, the recommendation of the possible parking space finding fits as far as possible. The EasyPark stickers (for the windshield) for 2 cars arrived promptly and are free of charge. Points are deducted due to the poor pricing. Either you take the overpriced subscription or pay a 15% surcharge on the parking price for occasional use. I paid ‚Ç¨ 3.97 in addition to the parking price of ‚Ç¨ 4.04 (‚Ç¨ 8.01 total) for a parking time of 1.5 hours. That's not exactly a snap. The next time I'll put some cash in my pocket beforehand, I won't use the app in the future unless a decent solution can be found for customers and providers.;3;2019-08-15;13.8;0.8522;positive
4765;Sabs72;Today after a long search I finally found a parking space and then I was stupid because I could not start the parking process.

4766;Rbugar;If the app works, everything is fine, but often it just doesn't work and the button to start the parking process just pulsates a little, but there is no further reaction. No message what the problem is or anything else. I've had that several times now. If you rely on this app and don't have any change with you, the parking ticket is virtually preprogrammed. Update: Contrary to the advice to contact customer service, which I have already done, it would be much more logical to teach the app a few meaningful error messages so that the customer is informed and not left perplexed and wildly pressing the park button.The KD was completely at a loss. Sure, you can't tell them what problem the app is currently having.;1;2021-09-27;15.27.1;-0.8968;negative

4771;thomasheppner;As if it wasn't enough of a good thing that you can buy a parking ticket in many places without panic for change. No, the service at EasyPark is even better than the app - "there you will be helped!" It's a shame that not all parking zones are shown on the map. But that is more likely due to the cities (officials), which are not able to provide the necessary geodata. But for these cases there is still the 5-digit code on the machine. Of course, parking via the app is a little more expensive, but the people behind EasyPark have to live off something. I think the surcharge is fair.;5;2018-09-30;11.4;0.7134;positive

4985;Barandur;The transaction fees are very often extremely high in relation to the parking fee, actually usury !!!Alternatively, take a look at the provider ParkNow! There are fees with every transaction! That in itself is completely understandable. The provider has to finance itself somehow, since the actual parking fee has to be paid back to the city. At easypark, these transaction fees can either be fixed and independent of the parking fees or they depend on the parking fee, which is the case in most of the parking zones at easypark! In the latter variant, the transaction fee can be very, very expensive!In Berlin, for example, it is 15% of the parking fee, but at least ‚Ç¨ 0.49 !!!49 cents is only 15% from a parking fee of around ‚Ç¨ 3.27!In Berlin, one hour usually costs ‚Ç¨ 1!So I would have to park for almost 3.5 hours so that I really only pay 15% of the parking fee as a transaction fee! From then on it becomes more and more expensive with the transaction fee!There are also parking zones in Berlin, where you pay ‚Ç¨ 2 per hour from 6pm to midnight. The 15% transaction fee for easypark is worthwhile from 1:45 a.m. parking time! Because from then on the transaction fee rises continuously! If I also consider that I often only park somewhere for half an hour for 50 cents, then the transaction fee is almost 100% of the parking fee and that's really bold! What actually happens if I want to extend the parking time? Do I then pay at least 49 cents again? There is another way:At ParkNow you only pay 25 cents per bookingor alternatively ‚Ç¨ 2.99 / month without charge per booking.1.67 That is why easypark only gets 1 star!;1;2019-02-23;12.5;0.7992;positive

4988;geplagter Handyparkkunde;Somebody was probably not paying attention and implemented the design draft of a nine-year-old girl without thinking too much. Even minor updates keep changing the UI, with a clear tendency "confusing" and "even more pink". Obvious activities such as setting the parking time etc. are hidden behind overloaded, pink rotary controls which, when cranking, also like to trigger a paid parking process at the same time. It has to look for Easter eggs first (yes, where could it be this time) and then a gambling component, great! Therefore, in case the gentlemen should have forgotten: The minimal task was a digital parking ticket. But they preferred to build an annoying app that repeatedly forces unexpected user interaction. _Everything_ shines really well with a lot of blingbling - just howling when you look at the average parking meter as an alternative. It seems to be particularly important to the current crew to display unexpected and pointless comments between the customers and the start of the parking process. Yesterday I had to talk to the policewoman for a long time because a parking process was ultimately not started. The app really wanted to tell me modally that I needed such a sticker in the car. Oh no, great thanks: I've been a "mobile phone parking customer" for 10+ years, and thus probably have a much longer business relationship with the company than most of my developers there. But I didn't know that I needed a sticker as a reference for the Zettelhex ... I'm curious when I will be told that cats cannot be dried in the microwave. Honestly, hopefully it will be something else, otherwise I'll switch back to change and parking machines, it doesn't sting so much in the eyes and it hurts a lot less behind the forehead.;1;2017-12-15;10.2;0.9731;positive
4990;harre63;I installed the app with great pleasure and am a committed user. Alone the crooked amounts (89 cents, 1.51 ‚Ç¨, ...) surprised me a bit - on the other hand: is a minute-by-minute billing ... The push notification then only says ‚ÄúTotal costs ‚Ç¨ 0.89. It was completely clear to me: these are the pure parking fees. So far so good, until I asked for an invoice. And lo and behold: in addition to the parking fee, I am charged 12 cents in transaction costs for each transaction. This is not shown or displayed anywhere (neither in the app store, on the website, nor anywhere else). If it is somewhere and I haven't found it, I beg your forbearance, at least I haven't found anything despite an intensive search. It is also interesting when you request the invoice for a transaction: Then you get the message that ‚Äúthe invoice will be sent automatically on the day of the debit‚Äù. Of course I checked that and as expected, an invoice never came on the day of the debit ... Only now, at the moment when I requested the invoice, it came to my email account by return post. Conclusion: I have nothing against service fees, because "what costs nothing is not worth" or collects data. BUT: To raise fees and not to present them transparently or to mark them in any other way is not possible for me and therefore, in my opinion, this is just modern highway robbery.;1;2020-02-02;14.8;0.8928;positive
4993;karl-georg;I've been using easypark since June. After the installation everything was fine. No problem! The possibility of saving the parking zone code and selecting it later from a list was particularly helpful. In Berlin there are areas where you park your car and look for the machine with a taxi. The parking zone memory was simply great! But then there was an update, everything should get better. Instead of the last parking zone, you now read a sequence of digits that of course has nothing to do with the correct code.Well, I reported it to easypark, a total of three times, they promised a correction soon, but nobody said when it would be soon.;4;2012-07-25;2.0;0.9233;positive

It is often difficult to estimate the time required, especially when traveling to a foreign city. The possibility of adapting the parking ticket to your own needs while on the go and not having to rush across town to extend it is definitely worth the extra charge for the parking fee.

5018;rkr 1959;I have been using EasyPark for years (including its predecessor) and I am absolutely satisfied - both with the service itself, as well as with the app and the further development in use ... The "spatial independence" from the vehicle is particularly good. I can control the parking process from any location that has access to mobile communications or the Internet - I don't have to be at the vehicle. The free phone number is also very good if the parking process is to be processed over the phone. The ease of use (both with the phone and the app) is also good - if you have got used to a few specific terms. E.g. "complete the parking process" means that the parking is ended - more clearly would be "end the parking process". Is only a small example and does not limit the absolutely positive evaluation. Over the years (initially as one of the first users for Berlin) I had contact with the support several times for various reasons and was regularly served in a friendly, fast and target-oriented manner.

The support was extremely unfriendly and cynical and had no desire to track down the problem (allegedly I would refuse to find a solution to the problem!). I have no idea what the problem is because it's not my APP and therefore I don't know what it could be!

5047;Karl Heinz Mustermann;I've been using EasyPark in Hamburg for around two years. When I was in Kassel for documenta 14, I got to know another system there to pay parking fees with the iPhone: travipay. Apart from the fact that the app offers more, for example information about local public transport and location determination is much easier, the transaction costs are also much lower there. With travipay you only pay 14 cents per parking transaction. To my great surprise, I also found that you can park with travipay in Hamburg and in many other cities. All in all, that even seems more to me than at EasyPark.

On the other hand, you save money if you get back to the car earlier than originally planned. This is well worth the pennies fee / often makes up for it.Request: save several parking zones as favorites in the app;4;2016-03-18;5.3;0.9664;positive

5059;KMBmike;The app works perfectly so far, but I installed it to save costs on short-term parking, but it doesn't work at all.Here with us, for example, half an hour of parking costs 90 cents if you insert a coin (this is also the minimum amount at the parking meters).If I enter this parking time into the app, i.e. 30 minutes (or less, e.g. 10 minutes), easyPark charges ‚Ç¨ 1.36. Extending the parking time to the minute only works to a limited extent, so in the app yes, but there are big leaps in terms of costs, which are ALWAYS more expensive than inserting coins. Despite the inside window sticker and paid parking time, a parking attendant also wanted to issue a parking ticket, which I saw in time. When I referred to the sticker, he just shrugged my shoulders ... so when parking time is activated, the app also says that you should put a note in the car ... then what is the inside window sticker good for?O.k., if you don't have any change at hand, then the app may make sense, therefore 2 stars, otherwise I recommend change, firstly it is generally cheaper and secondly you avoid misunderstandings with the park attendants.The app would be REALLY useful, among other things, only if it would charge correspondingly little, especially for short-term parking of e.g. 10 minutes, and not even charge more than you have to pay for half an hour by inserting a coin.;2;2016-01-22;5.2;0.9676;positive

That remains to be seen. However, I never receive the SMS that you should receive before the parking time expires. I had crashes with this app for the first time.

At Easypark, I have to decide in advance how long I want to park, using a completely coarse and cumbersome dial. I miss to extend - bad luck. Pay again. Mobile City had a widget that let you quickly call up the ongoing parking process from the lockscreen. At Easy Park? Nothing. Easy Park also has high hidden fees, so you think twice about which service you want to use.

This includes: - the zone determination by GPS- the valid tariff in the zone (so that you can estimate what the parking process will cost)- in what time must be paid in the current zone- Cost history of the last parking processes- Start and end parking (without time preselection) just as you can do it over the phone- Park reminder via push notification so that you don't forget to log out or when the parking time expires.

For private customers, however, the fee per parking process is 15%, but at least EUR 0.49, whereby the latter is only indicated by an asterisk in the footnotes - not nice.

5391;Cahoz;In the past [with mobilzahlen.de] everything worked smoothly (in augsburg and Berlin). Unfortunately not now. It's a shame actually ...;1;2013-05-18;3.0.12;-0.6705;negative
5392;Wuschl73;Was previously at mobilzahlen.de - the app was great. Has now passed into easypark. The network connection does not work !!!! Thus no booking is possible. In addition, I have previously paid a fee of ‚Ç¨ 0.14 per parking process, here it now costs at least ‚Ç¨ 0.49. The whole thing for the parking fee. This is really usury! I am completely dissatisfied :-(;1;2013-05-07;3.0.12;-0.6045;negative
5393;fhgtrsd;-Sixfold the fee through forced takeover of Mobil numbers.de (sometimes in DM for clarification: I should now pay almost ONE D-MARK (PER PARKING PROCESS!) Just for not using any coins ???? !!) -App that gets stuck and doesn't do what it's supposed to -Location function does not work -Credit card details can already not be entered. As a monopoly, the provider will only notice and change something if the customers - instead of simply stopping use - officially log off in a row and delete their accounts on the website. I'll do that right now. Too bad. Mobile numbers was a great thing. But I can be excluded elsewhere.;1;2013-03-17;3.0.9;-0.8492;negative
5394;Mizad;with the last parking zones? Never have I stood in -12345!I am now also wondering whether the app not only collects the money and the tickets are still issued by the police officers. A conversation with one of these ladies in Hanover was very informative and funny. Apparently only the business idea is good, the technology does not work or does not yet work reliably and often only when the policeman uses the cell phone and calls Easypark to verify the account.

5395;Phil816;... No more and no less. What bothers me most is that the last used parking zones are not saved, although it is offered as a feature. In these fields it always says "-19435";3;2012-12-18;2.2;-0.7602;negative

117;Hanne Muurinen;A very handy app, no need to bother with tickets. The software could be developed with the heads in mind so that the program cuts off parking when the location of the car changes more than the amount of gps sway.

For occasional use not so much. I would add here that the 21% you "save" is actually 6%. In other words, that +15% means that each parking costs 15% more than coins, so in the end it is 15%, for example ‚Ç¨ 2 for parking it makes ‚Ç¨ 0.30 more. That is 2.30 ‚Ç¨.

1387;Mika TL;A nice easy way to pay for parking only as much as you really need. Payment times are not correct in some areas, but it mainly works as it should. Even the monthly payments for the service do not end in dizziness.  A nice addition would be if you get some notification after the parking supervisor has checked the parking spaces found with the registration number from easy Park.

1412;Kisdfg;Completely substandard implementation for a good idea. Payment by credit card, ie must provide card information. Not by any means like this, but with mobile payment by phone bill and without registration obligation. And on top of all that, those stickers that need to be glued to the car. What if I park while renting a car? Will there be fines when the sticker is missing?  All private as well as public car parks should be included.  Due to credit card payment this should not be used. Never enter credit card numbers for these services.;1;2016-06-01;5.5;0.6941;positive
1413;Petem5;Before five stars, now only two. I forgot to upgrade to a new card and a few euros was charged on the invoice. Spiced with a billing surcharge, of course. My moka but I guess I still try another because this doesn't seem to develop into anything. I would have updated that card for sure the next time I use it though. 6s + support is still missing. A good app, by the way, even after its time. Two stars mainly because of the bad mood.  I went to Parkman.

However, I give 3.5 stars because when the need is rare, every couple of months, the base fee is not paused. I suggest a feature for the app that stops the "base charge" for example when the app is not used for two weeks.  Another great feature is location. When you drive into EasyPark's parking area, the app reports a parking ID based on location (area 301, will parking be started?).  These when you still get the app, you would definitely have a full five stars!;4;2013-06-26;3.1;0.95;positive

At Kilden in Kr.sand, they add a fee of 10% for using the app and that it does not take into account the free period for electric cars. There is also no info about parking prices and time pricing in the app, apart from the current price. Then it will not be full so easily anymore and you will not save money on using the app.;3;2021-07-14;15.23.0;0.6408;positive

Check and see if you two or three times if the app indicates the correct parking space, it is you who has to pay dearly if the app misses the location, which happens quite often. Then you have to pay both parking fee and penalty fee.

1700;Andr√© Mangseth;Steer away! I have experienced a fine despite using the app. It found the parking space, the code and the fare, but I was fined because I was still registered in a completely different zone, 8 km away. I contacted customer service and they thought I had pushed myself to the place myself (something I did not do) and that the code and rate was completely different than what the app stated.

Now in these corona times, it's okay to not have to use the vending machines. Nice to be able to get notice just before time runs out. Disadvantages: Could have been a little cheaper to use.

If you are delayed, just extend the parking inside the EasyParki app. EasyPark can also be used outside Norwayüëçüëçüëç ABSOLUTELY TOP !!!!;5;2019-12-24;14.6.1;0.6627;positive

This already exists in the form of an sms service that alerts when there are 15 minutes left, but this is too bad. The app itself should report both 15 and 5 minutes before the expiration time. Easypark benefits a lot from people forgetting the time. With the information the users provide with this app, you can probably track where the users are at any given time as well and structure the control accordingly!

And many payment machines have the wrong rate value in the app. Here in Arendal, it cost NOK 10 more per hour to use the app. The app only has 15 minutes' notice before it expires, and this costs NOK 1 per message. Then you pay for 15 minutes or less and you get no notice. Certainly a super app for commuters and workers who are going to meetings. But for private individuals, this app is useless and very expensive. Rather pay too much in the vending machine than to risk a fine with the app.;1;2016-11-28;5.8.1;-0.7402;negative

2834;DannyTheKid;It's EasyPark's Easy Money! They require a fee / subscription to have this agreement if you are to use their service. Before, my company had an agreement with them, then we had a sticker on the route, which we could call in via mobile to start / stop P-time. Ingenious can be said to save money, they said. The problem is that we had to pay several hundred kroner / month in the subscription for each car that is registered with EasyPark's register. Hold on tight! This app probably has the same function and the same profit for Easy Park - Easy money !!! But we have now dropped them to save money instead. Folks! Drop Easy Park and save money !!! Also avoid P-company parking traps where there is no information in the App that tells users about max. Parking time in that zone or a limit to max. Parking time. You can pay to EasyPark for 5-10 hours for a parking zone where you are ONLY allowed to park 0.5 hours. When you could also extend the parking time via mobile, which in certain cases exceeds the max. Parking time in that zone without knowing or remembering it. It can also lead to P-bot or what? Roger Stalheim had probably experienced that.

3037;brianrkf;EDIT: Thanks for your cheeky response, EasyPark Team. Unfortunately it was their app that made the mistake and not me, that's why I'm very annoyed. I chose the right zone (without time limit), have extended parking 2 times and the app only ended parking 25 minutes early, without any error message or without me doing anything to control the app to end parking‚Ä¶ Do not know what customer service will help me with then. Should I send you a signed confirmation from 3 family members who saw me extend the parking? I can try, then I can share my experience with other users here!  If there is any "hidden", illogical or unintuitive way to end parking that I was not made aware of in advance (as other 1-star reviewers here point out), then it is again just bad design in their app. Users can not read developers' thoughts.  ‚Äî-  The app confirmed 2 TIMES that I have demanded parking from 12:15 to 12:30 and then to 12:45, still I was fined NOK 600 because the parking was closed by itself at. 12.25, have no idea why‚Ä¶ I simply feel cheated!

3039;Freddyfena;Can definitely not recommend easypark. It is not enough that you charge an extra fee, as much as 15% in commission when paying P! The app is not very user-friendly and does not notify properly. Parking can be interrupted or never started for no reason even if it says it is running. Only the hub is so jargon that every sensible person should stay away. Change the name to "Park at your own risk" And when you talk to support, they will not understand that something is wrong. The customer has all responsibility and it is of course the customer who made the mistake and who thus has to pay a fine :-( Should uninstall the app immediately and warn everyone I meet.;1;2021-06-22;15.22.0;-0.7517;negative

Completely hopeless how they are doing. Hope no one else falls into the same trap, so ALWAYS check if you have not scrolled Christmas a little too far, because it will suddenly be very expensive.

Now it turns out that someone who borrowed the car a few months ago naturally put it in the app to pay for parking, and that is the reason why we are not allowed to use the app. Suggestions for developers: Write more informative error messages than type "Error.Message.11341". A message like "2 other people have added this car to their app. It can be in an app at most" would have been very helpful. If possible, allow several people to enter the same car, with camera parking activated. If that's not possible, let me see which other users have put the same car in the app, with phone number.

3212;Vilde S. Jensen;Hi! The app is very handsome and light-hearted, really useful for a busy everyday life! One thing I think could have been an improvement is this with the choice of car and registration number. Here it is very easy to make mistakes as a user, which for me and many others has resulted in a fine - despite the fact that you have actually paid, but for a registration number that does not exist or a car that was obviously not in the parking lot. One idea could be to have a two-step registration of car numbers, so that it is easier to detect errors in registration if these two do not match. Or possibly a check against a register, which means that the registration number that does not exist is not approved by the app, and checks if the first two letters are in the registration number at all. Personally, I missed "f" and pressed "r" in a hurry - and "NR" does not exist. But the cure was there, because this was my fault, which I agree with! (Despite the fact that I think the parking attendant should have looked for the car he had paid for, and not found this, and then looked between his fingers and thought "here is someone who has been human to misprint in the app".) By improving it I have mentioned above, I think the app would be more "foolproof" and even more would have enjoyed and trusted the app, and that parking attendants do not have to take the brunt of the user's mistakes - which is often awkward to admit as a user :);3;2019-03-03;12.6;0.9737;positive

Even if the parking is closed from the phone, the app will not update on the clock and shows that the parking is active.

Clearly you do not care much about the apple watch app for so long. Hope this changes in the future as it could be a perfect app to have on your wrist.;2;2019-01-03;12.0;0.7828;positive

3241;Daffy Hagen;The wheel works but not as well as the digital, will have it back. And can you make it possible that the map does not come up by default? I park 90% of the time in the same place and have to wait until the whole fancy zoom animation is finished before I can go to pick my place which is my favorite. Should be an option in settings where you can choose between maps / where you are or a favorite place by default when starting the app. Otherwise good app and uses every day.;4;2018-10-17;11.5;0.8917;positive
3242;joyroydihzlhxljcljc;The app is great, but you have consistently written the code on the vending machines in such small print and then on the page that you have to go all the way to the vending machine to see it.

3243;amcarmom;The app itself is very user-friendly What goes down horribly is that you can quickly get a parking ticket if you are not vigilant. In other words, do not use this app if you have a bad time, are stressed or not. When you park the car, the app will find a parking machine for you and you will have an opportunity to pay. There are several vending machines near each other and the app is just as happy to give you one that does not belong to the parking lot you are in. Once I was parked with several people, I had paid correctly but three friends were fined for their cars next to mine because they had paid at the wrong vending machine I have now been fined myself because I have relied on the app in stress. I have done everything right but have paid for an appliance that was a little further away and not for what belonged to my parking lot. This was in the same parking lot and with a few meters in between So sum summarum, the idea around the app, usability etc. is very good but it can quickly become expensive to use If you want to use this app, you must each time go to the machine you find in the corresponding place you are in and then manually enter the machine ID So it does not hold to see the machine "over there" A good - and necessary, I mean - change on this app had to be that it on the map showed ALL the P. machines around where you stood, not just one!;2;2018-12-12;11.7.1;0.589;positive

Information about this extra cost is given in VERY small print on the information poster by the parking meter (has one picture from the machine at location 7127 in √Ölesund as an example, but may not attach it as an appendix in this review). It is important to be aware that the surcharge of 15% gives a significant additional cost for parking over a longer period of time. When using, for example, payment by card at a vending machine, parking can also be terminated earlier so that the use of the app does not provide any cost savings (unless you temporarily drive in / out of the car park during your stay and want to end parking payment for the period you are out. parked for more than 10 hours per day, you should still pay for one day and then there is not necessarily any savings when using the app .... maybe rather the opposite);2;2018-09-04;11.2.1;0.5023;positive

3282;dpkra;This app costs me a parking fine because it took the wrong code for the parking place. It lacks a proper check for what you type in for parking code. The parking code of 3 or four digits are prone to mistakes in typing and complaining to easypark does not help as they are not the one renting out the parking lot. Easypark is not interested to improve the app as Europark makes more money with errors of the user. Strongly recommend to write these complaints so that the app gets improved. Parking lot codes should not be very similar. I had to type 9445 (Sandnes) but easypark app registered 944, which was a parking lot in Oslo.  Called immediately when I saw the fine in the window of my car. Everybody makes typing errors on the mobilphone. The software should be better and only a numeric keyboard should be given (similar when I use the Bank ID on my phone) to reduce the change on typing errors.  Finally do not use this app. Please boycot it until improved. My comments to Easyparc should be valued the 600kr fine!!  The answer of Easyparc is that they all have 4 digit codes. I am 100% sure that I did not type 0944. How can then 944 be written on the historic confirmation of my payment. See for yourself!  Good luck with your Appüëé;1;2018-08-28;11.2.1;0.9665;positive

Great pleasure and ready to pay with the app and have the same functionality as usual.  In the app I was asked about reg no, and with a rental car and Italian sign I was told that this was probably not true (probably since I was Norwegian). Could the pressure continue, but not sure if I had done something wrong, there was payment with coin this time as well  Proposed solution  How about having your own functionality for a rental car. Put the car in a time-limited period (because you do not want it on your list) called rental car (or borrowed car). Ask when it is entered which country it is registered in, and verify the sign against this country.  This will make the world much easier for us who travel a lot and rent a car;4;2018-07-05;11.0;0.9589;positive

3332;Kamfs;I like this app very much, as I can stop and extend the parking time from the mobile. But I have some criticisms:  After the last update, you removed the digital clock, something I can not understand. The wheel is very cumbersome, especially if you have to park for many hours or days. See that you have previously answered other comments here, that it should come back at the end of January. I can not find it.  Then I have to say that I am skeptical that customers have to pay you 15% of the parking fee. It is in the highest team. If you know of other digital solutions (eg bus), you get a discount for buying a ticket digitally. This, or at least not a higher price, should also be the case at EasyPark.;2;2018-03-13;10.4.1;-0.5187;negative

There are also no vending machines to put money on. Finally, I had to call Europark in Oslo and read out my card details to get paid for parking outside my home in Troms√∏.

3615;fatso83;Gets a good first impression. Admittedly a bit much registration (how about getting from the population register?), But ok as long as it is only done once. BUT ... this is of course not the case: - /  As soon as you have gone through the registration process, and been notified that you are done, you will come to a new form where you have to fill in much of the same info again.  After you finally finish (again) you can use the app. It works well, but has potential for improvement. What about scanning the regnr, lookup of place based on postal code, or pre-filling based on lookup on telephone number / birth number?  It also adds quite hefty - enables server communication in background processes instead of better ux.  The "Give us feedback" form does not work. Nothing happens. Slightly ironic ...

Now in the last update you have actually managed to make it useless! Now I do not get started at all ... But you get 1 star for great color and logo on the start page. Impressive that such a, relatively, simple app can start so slowly.;1;2013-05-25;3.1;0.8845;positive
3642;frieil;Now this is almost perfect as a tool. But still does not get top marks due to lack of editing ability for the favorites (trash can does not work. Possibly a bug that needs to be fixed). To you who think that this is free: In the long run, it will be cheaper than risking a parking fee if you have not returned to the car after the parking time has expired. Also: If you receive a fee, even though it is registered in the system that the car is legally parked, it is easier to complain about incorrectly charged fees. And: This is a company that has an agreement with a huge number of owners of parking spaces both here in Norway and some other countries. It is a great advantage to have an agreement here at EasyPark. :);4;2013-04-26;3.0.10;0.9855;positive

3645;Mr.Qee;Super good! But I wonder if it is possible to have either 2 accounts or 2 bank accounts you can switch between in the app, so you do not have to enter new login info every time ..

3647;FredrikDude;The start-up fee for the service is NOK 149, but you can have several vehicles on the same subscription. Has saved me too much time!

3660;Flickname;This is great service, but the GUI is lousy. Where you choose the zone the field is tiny and the wheel which has no value takes up the entire screen. The button for GPS the same. Rather, redesign the design to have the latest selections as buttons and use the drop down on time selection.

3662;TorsteinHyl;I love the easypark concept, and use it regularly at work. But I dislike the app. I only come across small things such as the way you enter the zone number (why not mark the number that is there before), or that the text "spin to select time" meets you every time you use the app (when you use the app several times a day you remember it ...). Have never got the correct zone number by pressing the "nearby" button, possibly I have only had bad luck with the places I parked, but it does not work the first five times the threshold is a bit high to give it more chances. Fortunately, it has become easier to spin to the exact times after the previous update, so they should be praised for listening to feedback. That said, can not quite put my finger on why it is an app I dislike, maybe it's just a design thing ...;4;2013-03-10;3.0.9;0.7396;positive

3675;RihannaGirl;EasyPark is a bit more expensive (15%), but means that as long as the phone is with you do not need money or a Visa card. You receive a text message 15 minutes before the parking time expires, and can thus extend the time from the dentist's chair or where it should be. Too bad EasyPark is available everywhere you are required to pay a parking fee - then the parking inspectors would be unemployed and the fines would almost be gone!;5;2013-02-10;3.0;-0.68;negative
3676;HgsdFan;I am super happy and think it is fantastic to be able to extend the packing time from the middle of the queue at the doctor's office or at a store! You pay for the time you stand, and for me it does not matter that it costs 15% extra. How often have I not stuffed vending machines with coins to avoid fines if time runs out from me, and wasted money by ending up driving long before time runs out ?!

3695;IdaAmandaS;Like the new update, mn think the wheel is impractical. Called customer service the other day and was then informed that there will be an update that allows you to choose the wheel or. the "old method" so that you can enter the time manually as before. Then it will be perfect.  Clever that you can also enter cars and tariff groups yourself and make nicknames for them. the note field on each parking lot is a good way to keep track.

3698;Gaggis;New update: The app has been upgraded and is now close to perfect! GPS function has arrived and you can enter favorites. Glorious! EasyPark has saved me a lot of money and paying for parking has become almost fun!  Update of previous review: Yesterday I sent a new email about a non-functioning app to EasyPark. I got an answer today and during the day and after a reinstall today it works again! Brilliant!! Also get a receipt on sms !! Now only GPS function is missing so the app gets top marks from me !!  Previous mention: I use EasyPark diligently and have saved large amounts on parking. Arguments that it costs a lot to use EasyPark do not hold if you park a lot and for example are a lot in meetings with a somewhat uncertain end time. EasyPark is an ingenious solution and the app worked well to begin with, but for far (!) Long now it has not worked properly. I wrote an email to EasyPark about this several months ago where they replied that they are working hard to fix this. It turns out (obviously) that is not true. The concept is ingenious. Had the app worked, it would also have been ingenious, but now I only use the ring solution until further notice. When the app is updated and the receipt + GPS function is also included, the app gets top marks from me, but when will the app be usable again ..?;5;2013-01-10;3.0;0.9256;positive

Either it does not connect, or you start paying for the parking and when you arrive you find the fine, it does not let you extend the parking lot ... And being the maximum parking period two hours they give you a margin of one hour to eliminate the penalty, That is to say, I pay 2 hours, or so I think, I don't worry and fine with no margin for correction, don't use it, don't risk piling up fines.;1;2021-06-10;15.22.0;-0.9059;negative

My bad score is based on the fact that it does not allow stays of less than 30 minutes and for those 30 minutes (which in a parking meter cost 30cent.) They charge you 18cnt. commission, 60% seems like a real scam.

4226;Juan Manuel Hern√°ndez Castro;Terrible application. Poor interface, transfer of deleted data from e-park without knowledge and consent, and in the first parking lot a fine after paying the ticket with the application by mistake.

4227;isabel marta vazquez;I would like to know if you can pay for the parking of two cars at the same time. With e-park it was perfectly possible and now I don't see the way.

4228;Agueda Alvarado;I have been trying to pay with several different bank cards for 3 days and it turns out that every time I enter the card data it appears to me as inactive, when they are cards that I use daily without any problem, this is really disastrous.

4239;A. Pereira;Lousy I loved e-park, the change has been for the worse and I'm only using it because I still have a balance. I do not find it "user friendly" and I have also felt ripped off. I had a valid ticket but when I tried to extend the parking time, it was impossible (it gave me error after error) and after several unsuccessful attempts I had to create a new ticket. To my surprise, when I saw the details, I paid more in application fees (‚Ç¨ 0.18) than for the parking itself (‚Ç¨ 0.20). GOODBYE EasyP;1;2021-03-22;15.18.0;-0.705;negative

4245;Mayca Ezcurra;I do not think it is very ethical that customers change our app to Easypark WITHOUT the option to refund the amount. I don't want to pay you commissions and by the nose that EPark has not given me the option of not having anything with you. If I chose EPark it was for convenience and of course, without commissions and I just read that you charge even for notifying. _____ I leave my previous comment I modify *, because I have not used it yet, but I have my balance of ‚Ç¨ 9.

It is not free, and unlike epark it is not very intuitive to use. Update: It is a bit scam, they charge commission on the base value instead of on what is actually paid for the parking meter, a ticket of ‚Ç¨ 1 and commission ‚Ç¨ 0.21, and the minimum commission ‚Ç¨ 0.18 although I only parked 10 mins. With what I have used, I am paying a commission between 30 and 40% of the real cost of the parking meter !!;1;2021-03-14;15.17.1;-0.8284;negative
4264;Natalia Bielza Lino;With easypark it is more expensive than doing it directly in the street. Before with epark it did not happen. How is it possible?. I was forced to change because they sent me an email telling me that epark stopped working. It does not work well for me, there is no way to recharge money and having a balance for the street guards does not work out that you have paid parking. Is there a way to return to epark? It is a hoax.;1;2021-03-14;15.15.1;-0.8546;negative
4265;Edu S.;Not bad ... Worse. The payment system, after the App locates you with gps. It gives example errors (I park in La Coru√±a, at 06:00 in the morning and when I have to make the first payment at 10:00, my phone and I are in Santiago. I look for where I have it parked on the map. Mess and fine "It was easier before, you indicated the area, if it was blue, red or orange.

4308;Mario Dominguez;The consultation / cancellation of sanctions systematically fails ... They allege that being an external server they do not have control over the cancellation of sanctions and thus clean their hands, and despite the complaints they do not fix the "error". Another separate issue is that they have removed the option for the user to deliver or "fish" a ticket with valid time remaining, I do not approve of the fact that they remove that option from me in the app when it is regularly done between users on the street. This app should be improved without a doubt;1;2021-02-26;15.17;0.8237;positive

4330;Ta Blet;Regrettable. They charge commission. It does not allow you to indicate the parking area manually, you have to activate location. If you put the ticket when the regulated schedule has not started, you have to go round and round the wheel until it reaches the starting time. If they had started from scratch it would be understandable, but the sad thing is that ePark had all this. As soon as I spend the balance I had in ePark, I will go to the competition that in Santander does not charge a commission.;1;2021-02-21;15.10;-0.7603;negative

4335;Elias Tabarez;Bad with greed, designed to trick you into overpaying. It does not allow to extend the tickets.

4346;Carlos Urzaiz;I also come from epark .. And I can only say that I am very sorry for his disappearance. Easy park is a real disaster. Yesterday they passed me by obligation to this monstrosity. It is not intuitive. It does not report on the new conditions, or it does so in a cryptic way. It does not allow confirmation of parking, so if a mistake is made, either by the user or by the application, there is no going back. Yesterday I was testing the application from my home, since I had to go to Madrid an hour and a half later. He tells me at 5:50 p.m. that I am parked, and that it ended at 7:19 p.m. without giving the option to confirm, I called by phone and there was no way to go back. They blamed the City Council. And to me the anger for not reading the conditions I have entered the application several times and there is no way. It is possible that I am stupid, as they came to suggest, but as I see from the opinions, there are many of us. It is possible that the application is only for gifted people, so I will unsubscribe as soon as the claim that I have filed with the City Council is resolved. In the end I parked at twenty past six with the uncertainty of the possibility that four hours would pass and end up sanctioned. Fortunately, it was not. In short, a disaster.

The handicap of migration is important, I mean that with the old epark you ensured the digital payment of the parking meter, with a cost of ‚Ç¨ 0, and quite acceptable functionalities. It costs the one that now has to pay a commission, and also high, because in short installments, for example 0.15 cts. you pay more in commission than in the cost of the parking itself.

4408;Angel Garcia;I would like to withdraw my balance because I no longer use it. Now they charge me VAT, which they didn't before. The app must be sustained with the saving of paper and ink from the parking meters or service commission by the interested parties. Not at the expense of the consumer, who is also obliged to pay VAT on their seized balance from another application that did not charge it. In short, 1 hour in Santander 75cts with the 91 app, 21% more expensive than putting in the coins;1;2021-02-02;15.15.1;0.6486;positive

4522;David Yebenes;I have just used E-Park and the change to easyPark has been worse, application less intuitive and with very high commissions that we did not have before, 10% of the service, for short parking you pay more for the "service" of easypark than for your own rate. As soon as the balance runs out, I uninstall it. A pity that we cannot continue enjoying E-park;1;2020-12-28;15.14.1;-0.8164;negative
4524;Nacho Molinelli Fern√°ndez;We went from a bad application (Epark) to an infumable one (EasyPark). Once changed they no longer let you go back to the previous one. Lousy interface and constant crashes. You cannot see the complaints or cancel them from the app as in the other. They send you to the web and it doesn't work. Also now charges a commission for a worse service.;1;2020-12-26;15.14.1;-0.9208;negative

4556;Maria Garcia;After critical and even negative reviews and being able to communicate by phone with them, I have to say that, in my case, the problem lies in a technical problem of information that the application gives the user, which leads to confusion about the use and cost of the application. app. Once explained by Tony, everything has been clarified and I have been able to confirm with my invoices that there is indeed no extra charge for the service.

4571;Iv√°n GM;An unintuitive interface, especially at the beginning that you have to look for the parking situation on the map so that it allows you to get the ticket from the blue zone.

4572;Ignacio Fort;I give a star because I cannot give less. They force you to switch to easypark if you don't lose your epark balance. The first two parking lots are fine, from the third you get the surprise, which has been a hoax. Epark worked well and provided a service and now it is up to others to profit from commissions. I want my balance to be returned and I will uninstall the app. Also do not tell me to call a 911 number for payment as you do in other comments.;1;2020-12-15;15.14.1;0.8252;positive

As soon as the balance runs out I plan to uninstall it, a shame that ePark stops working because it was fucking great. EasyPark no. And it does not allow to return to ePark, come on, all "advantages". And answering: entering an address is another way to locate the vehicle. With ePark you only had to set the type of zone for the rate, nothing more. I'm sorry but after a week of use it seems infinitely worse, more expensive, less intuitive, more intrusive and invasive of privacy, etc. I stand by my opinion.;1;2020-12-11;15.14.1;-0.6675;negative

4609;Lorien H;Not very intuitive when adding the payment method since where you must add it first, a website will appear to pay the fine. When paying for the parkmeter you must do it by location. Once the active ticket is over, you must locate where the car was to pay for another period of time, while you are already away from the car. With epark everything was easier.

4699;Yo mismo S;The change from e-park to easyPark represents an increase in what they have been paying for parking.

4720;Jorge CE;Shameful, I changed from epark with ‚Ç¨ 20 balance without clearly noting that the conditions changed (from having no commission to having it, and high!). That is a unilateral change of conditions without prior clear alert, for captive clients. That's how we matter to them. It is at the legal limit, but it is not ethical or fair. They should have made it possible to deplete the existing balance without commissions and indicate them when recharging. I will unsubscribe. Indicate the conditions in the description of the app!

4867;Pedro S√°nchez Escamilla;So far it works fine. I would score more if the system charged at the times indicated by the parkmeter. If I want to put the parking meter at 2:30 p.m. for example and the prayer starts at 4:30 p.m., I should start charging from 4:30 p.m. and not before. Other apps work with the time of the parkmeter. Good things I see, you do not have to leave money on deposit. Each payment is a collection. You can assign the zone with a code and forget about the street. Keep improving.

By the way, I don't live in Madrid. I live in Coru√±a. And once you give it to cancel, the solution so that you don't get fined is to pay again. I said, an application scam.

Apart from the higher prices, the gigantic button where the time is chosen is badly thought out. You have to turn the wheel to mark the time and one millimeter away is the "Start Parking" button, so it is extremely easy to hit it by mistake. And if you have fallen short, great, but if you spend time, because you were still adjusting it, too bad. To overpay. Furthermore, in Madrid you cannot stop parking. So, you hang on and EasyPark wins a little more with your mistake. I want to think that this button is badly designed and not done with all the intention.

On top of that, you are so shameless not to warn you and CHEAT by showing an active ticket message, so if I don't find out in time, on top of it Fine.

Now, when you hit the wheel to choose the time, you have to be very fine because you still haven't set the parking time you need, but accidentally when you turn you give it to start. Which is right in the center ... the same thing happens to cancel, you can do it without wanting to!  It would not be bad if I asked you for CONFIRMATION before either of those two actions. Or they put the buttons elsewhere, or a less complicated system than turning the wheel to select the duration of your parking ... Anything I can think of is better than this.  In my city the blue zone ends at 9:00 p.m., but the app allows you to pay all night .....  To top it off, prices have risen ... I'm afraid I'm going back to coins!

It is not easily found, although it is, the car parks in progress. In addition, it does not indicate the time at which it is no longer necessary to pay (in other applications it jumps directly to the next day) which leads to confusion.

5142;DanCasRom;The UX is a far cry from the previous E-park app. The click to action for the payment method is terrible, instead of putting the Time and Payment selector apart, they put both on a wheel and the one that your finger goes slightly, they charge you without prior confirmation, the time marked in that moment by the wheel, so that you cannot verify if it is correct or not, nor cancel the payment.  I feel cheated!! Exactly that has happened to me, not being able to cancel the parking made by mistake, because there is no button for it, I wrote an email to the customer service email, telling them what happened and attaching data and a screenshot. They have called me by phone (which I appreciate), and the answer is that "in Madrid they cannot cancel or cancel errors, because the city council does not allow them that option."  I understand that the city council can set some rules, but if so, then EasyPark should change the current design of the payment mode (at least in Madrid, put separate buttons for selecting time and payment) so that it is not so easy to make the mistake to pay for a parking that you do not want to do or for the unwanted time. Otherwise, it will seem that they want to take advantage of all those charges committed by mistake.  I will report both the app and the city council to the consumer office, because I honestly think it is a real scam towards users and customers.  Of course, I do not recommend anyone to use this app, at least as long as they do not change the payment method.;1;2021-06-07;15.22.0;-0.9707;negative

To begin with, it is a lot less intuitive. As another user mentions, it makes no sense that for it to take you until 9:00 the next day, you have to keep hitting the wheel. In ePark, at 9 pm he was already jumping the next day. After that, he won't let you put on until 9:00 p.m. It must be at 8:59 p.m. If you get caught by one of traffic that minute you get a safe fine because that last minute is not covered. Afterwards, I don't know if they don't have designers or UX but the little wheel thing is much worse than what there was before (which was more like a half slider).

5183;Nacho Tejerina;Previously, I had the e-park application and it said that in a single click it would pass your data (car license plates, balance, etc.) to EASYPARK. Well, that is not true and due to a failure in the application, my data has not been passed correctly and I have been fined.  When complaining about this error in the application, the customer service was disregarded and their treatment has been regrettable, without offering any type of solution.

Instead of at 10:23 I am setting at 11:00 with the wheel (which on top of it goes the other way around) "extend more time if you want to extend it" ????

I received several notices when my parking time was about to end so that I could renew it if necessary. When I changed the application, I was not notified and they have given me a fine that also cannot be canceled ...  For my part, I do not think I will use it again and what is more, I spoke with the person who gave me the fine because I looked for it to ask for information and he has told me to use another application ...

In the Epark map there were references to shops, offices, hospitals that helped you to find yourself, obviously I don't know the streets where I park !!

It is easier for you to find a way to cancel the ticket in order to save, it will not take 3 seconds, but canceling it is too easy !! These criticisms and I just put it ...

5350;Nibifi;Good iPhone with iOS 12.0.1 on 10/24/18 the app does not open For the rest, I have always been very good and very practical. If you can resolve the update it will be great again Thanks;4;2018-10-24;11.5;0.9402;positive
5353;Nicolai77;Constantly giving errors when I most need the app. So frustrating! For example ‚ÄúCould not connect to server 11315.‚Äù Using newest version and full internet access.;1;2018-11-02;11.6;-0.6166;negative
5356;Liptikal;Excellent application to forget about the ticket. It would be nice if the notifications were louder, kind of alarm clock. And that you could choose, for example, the frequency of notification of them, for example when there will be 5 minutes or 30 or what you will need. To be able to put more than one vehicle with the same app !! Otherwise, it does its job.;5;2018-02-16;10.3.1;0.5409;positive
5359;Hanni(3al1986;It is a shame that you have to pay in a blue zone that according to the law is illegal, but it is even more ashamed to have to pay commissions for using this app;1;2018-09-13;11.2.1;-0.867;negative
5360;RupeDeRuperta;The application works quite well. But it is much more to pay through the application. Almost double. So a full-blown scam !!!;2;2018-09-10;11.2.1;-0.8245;negative
5364;balal√≠;I have used EasyPark this weekend and due to its malfunction, the time that I marked in the App (Saturday 2:03 pm) was not set and it changed to 11am, no notification was sent and on Sunday when I got the car I had a fine for having passed the hour. I called today and they are not responsible for ANYTHING. Shame of service and app. DO NOT TRUST EASYPark !! Or you will almost certainly have to pay a fine !!!;1;2018-07-02;10.9;-0.8109;negative
5368;Doctor_Morbius;Nov-2017 Confirmed: CANNOT pay in my city and the application supports payment !!!  Sep-2017 In my city it seems that it can no longer be used, but the application still supports payment. It recognizes my location as a valid area to pay with this App so I thought that both could be used. ERROR !!!;1;2017-11-29;10.0.3;-0.5953;negative
5370;CarmenMM;I have been using it for more than a year and not a single fault. They annoy the 19 cents per operation but it is compensated by putting the maximum time and then stopping it when you leave, so they only charge you for the time you are there. It is a convenience not to have to be with the tickets. The only negative is not having the option to expand before your time is up.;4;2016-01-05;5.2;-0.6829;negative
5372;Ctujvfryn;It has not worked for a year in Sant Joan Despi, after paying correctly with EasyPark, I found the complaint. Now I have a nice proof of payment from EasyPark and a complaint of ‚Ç¨ 24.04 from sant joan despi for not paying the blue zone. Everything seems to work fine, the GPS validates the area, but they no longer work with them. A shame that EasyPark does not update the zones it works with.;1;2017-05-29;5.8.6;-0.7311;negative
5374;Pablomar81;It is very well thought out, even if it has a small commission. I give it 2 stars because if I give it 30 minutes and in 5 I finish it always keeps thinking and never lets me STOP IT, it stops when it reaches 30 min. If you solve the problem, it would be the best, and I will change my vote.;2;2017-01-26;5.8.4;0.7733;positive

5379;Balzak_vn;Doesn't provide true information for the amount of  the parking fee, above the fee that they are charging for their fake service, and after this they collect more money from the bank account than the amount in the invoice!!
