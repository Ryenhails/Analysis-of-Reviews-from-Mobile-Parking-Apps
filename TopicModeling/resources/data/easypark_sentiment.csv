I suddenly uninstalled it and reinstalled it three times, nothing to do. Too bad .;4;2020-03-05;15.1;-0.798;negative

401;Daniel Delacour;Hello, I have been using your app for a long time with no problems so far. I parked at 2:31 pm in the city center which offers 15 free minutes. I accepted them and started my clock until 4:30 p.m. When returning to my vehicle I found a fine of 25 ‚Ç¨ for unpaid parking. At no time was I informed that the clock stops after the 15 free minutes. (14:46) We should not be able to turn the wheel to go to the desired time. I made a complaint to the town hall of my city which refused my request. I am therefore obliged to pay when I was in good faith. Can you do a little business gesture? On the other hand, in my city parking is free from 12 p.m. to 2 p.m. I have noticed several times that it was not possible to switch on from 2 p.m. if you arrive before (eg I go to the sport at 2 p.m., so I have to park from 2.45 p.m. and I pay the 1 / 4 of an hour when it should be free.

502;Serge Moreno;the practical side you can pay without being in front of a terminal, hence the star. the negative side ... no free end of parking warning (it's expensive 0.15 cts to send a text). erratum: there is indeed a visual warning, but it disappears quickly, and if you have the phone in your pocket, no sound. one afternoon in Bordeaux missed 2 warnings, fortunately the asvp did not pass in the area.;1;2019-02-15;12.5;-0.946;negative

819;MathildeC51400;Hello, so far I was satisfied with the application but I was recently fined 25 ‚Ç¨ because I parked in Reims, around noon, I activated my parking lot to be "quiet" until 3pm but it didn't work because from 12pm to 2pm it's free, then follow the 15min free parking so I can't increase the parking time .. I was supposed to relax in town and I didn't not ceased to be disturbed by the application.As a result, I only managed to pay from 3:20 p.m. to 3:28 p.m. and from 3:38 p.m. to 3:51 p.m. ... incomprehensible I could not add extra time to my parking lot because it was supposedly already underway. When I get to my vehicle, I realize that I will be fined because I have a little piece of paper explaining it to me on the windshield. To date I have just received the fine of ‚Ç¨ 25. I don't find that normal. How come the app is not smooth and indicates that you are parked when you are not.I am really disappointed and unhappy that I had to pay a fine when I wanted to pay for my parking.I should have paid the old fashioned way, with change in the meter.I wish you update your app to fix the bugs because you risk losing honest people like me who just want to pay what they owe without worrying about their parking every 5min.Regards.;1;2019-09-26;14.0;0.8373;positive

1445;Andrew Nelson;This app suffers from a fatal flaw. Using the GPS, if it cannot find on its system a 'parking area' it will not let you pay for parking, EVEN IF YOU ARE ALREADY IN A DESIGNATED PARKING SPACE. It only says 'no parking area found' and won't allow payment even when unlimited spaces are available. After my initial review I received comments from the developer so I went out SPECIFICALLY TO TEST THE APP AGAIN. I parked in a designated parking space - TWICE. On both occasions the app showed 'no parking area found' - as was shown with screenshots. Also shown were the photos taken within seconds of those screenshots showing available parking. Easy-Park took over e-Park, which always worked without difficulty, (also took over my credit with them). . . and now I have this flawed app instead.

I park 1-3 times a week in vognmagergade in KBH. I always arrive early to get that seat with the least chance of car dents. When I used the parkman, it always found my position fairly quickly, but after the switch to easypark, it can take 10-20 seconds more. I always keep an eye on it finding the carmaker's street, because it may well place one on one of the streets next to it, but it is in the same zone (red). A little bit thin to blame the GPS as it obviously works fine with the parkman. Is forced to use easypark, because the company I work for has chosen to use it, and what is with it is easier than sitting and messing with vouchers in hand and spending money yourself.;1;2019-03-11;12.6;0.5761;positive

I accidentally stopped my parking prosses during unlocking phone with app open. But the absolute worst ist the background power consumption!

2037;Matija ≈Ωerdin;What I do like: ability to pay without actual use of cash and to renew parking from a distance. What I don't like: 1) minute dial is cumbersome and useless, since you will pay the full hour amount for anything between 1 minute and 1 hour. Either change to 1 hour intervals wihout the dial button, or interpolate price to 10 minute intervals, as the paper bills allow already. Or do both. 2) design suggestion: when you authorise payment, actively ask which car you want to pay for. Current design keeps the last parked car as default, therefore I got a parking fine a few times because I didn't notice I had chosen the wrong car. 3) design suggestion: allow for more than one simultaneous parking from the same app. E.g. If I want to pay for my wife, a friend or other member of my family. Current design does not allow it. I liked the previous app much better.;2;2018-12-06;12.0;0.837;positive

There was no mentioning of this when I started using it 2) once the app failed to send a push notification when the parking was about to expire. I found out later the parking had expired 15 min earlier 3) for some reason the max parking time has been limited to 2h. It is impossible to set the timer to longer period. You have to stop the timer or let the time expire and start a new parking. So what happens if I'm at the cinema when the 2h expire (this happened to me yesterday) and I am unable start a new parking with the app? Does Easypark pay my parking ticket if I get one?!

The possibilities were exhausted, and yet an employee at one of the restaurants at the parking lot was able to confirm that EasyPark had handed out several fees. Ultra bad style.

The idea of adding this feature without a way to turn the feature off was terrible: I spend several tens of euros every month in parking fees using this app, I expected more care on their side. While we are at it, the app user experience is pretty terrible... It is quite obvious that most people often park in the same zone with the same car, but no help from the app about this.  EDIT: Thanks for the reply EasyPark team. Much better with the update that let me disable the position tracking, however this should be the default, many will notice the battery drain, but only a few will check the settings and will deinstall: you may lose customers IMHO. About the setting to save the last area/car, great, but good UI should not me require to check under settings for such a feature, should hint me directly the right thing in my view.

Meaning it costs extra to have enabled. So it's very easy to miss it and your time expires. 3) An electronic free digital pdf with the receipt sent over email costs extra.

This means that the customer can choose between paying 15 percent extra to the company or SEK 59 a month. The first alternative also adds one kroner for each SMS reminder and three kroner per receipt by e-mail.In practice, this means that a parking fee that in a parking machine would have cost SEK 200 incl. receipt instead costs 200 + 30 (15%) + 3 (receipt) = SEK 233A frivolous crap company that uses all loopholes to cream us consumers on as much as they can according to. current legislation ...

Sometimes my car disappears from the list and every other time an ongoing parking has disappeared or I have not been able to start parking! Have had to close the app, open it again and repeat this procedure maybe 4-5 times before the parking is visible and I can finish or start it. Compared to the SMS Park app, this is a joke! When I moved from SMS Park to this new one, I also received a warning. "The format of your registration number does not match the standard format of your region / country" or something like that.

2949;Erkkii;The opposite of respect for the customer. Takes at least 15% surcharge on each invoice for, according to its own statement, so-called "Innovative parking solutions". What is innovative with a white painted window on asphalt can of course be discussed. How each invoice completely sonic can also get a mandatory half-hidden surcharge cost of 15% in retrospect instead of the cost of the parking itself (the one you as a customer see) also feels worth thinking about. It is also worth noting how this unavoidable surcharge is also stated to amount to a minimum of SEK 5 - ie. in many cases, perhaps closer to 50% of the invoice cost for, for example, those who park for a shorter period of time or in less expensive parking spaces. The company offers very few payment solutions, no e-invoice and charges the above fee, in addition to the parking fee, regardless of payment method. If you fail to opt out of a paper invoice, you have a SEK 25 distribution fee (quite juicy even that for a parking fee of SEK 8).

On a couple of occasions when I parked in the first-mentioned place, a warning box "It was not possible to park" has appeared, but when I clicked on it, the parking started.

3090;DeveloperX;Ok, so the municipality is changing service provider from Parkster to Easy Park. Fine, whatever ... installs the app, puts in the car and will renew the housing ticket for another six months. First of all, I was not allowed to choose the payment method when buying, but it took the card associated with my Apple Wallet straight off, even if I would like to use another card, strangely required and implemented - you should inform the customer early in the purchase phase where the money is withdrawn and give the opportunity to add cards, as it is implemented now you get a big "meh!" from me as a system architect and developer. Another thing is that I expected Easy Park to match Parkster's functionality (if the municipality did a good job in procurement), unfortunately it turned out that Easy Park has no function to choose the date when my housing ticket will take effect but assumes that I want DateTime.Now () so now I lose one day and SEK 70 in value, fun - thanks for that!;2;2021-02-14;15.16.0;0.9737;positive

In addition, you charge a service fee of at least SEK 4.95 or 15% on parking (becomes interesting when you park where the first 3 hours are free, then it suddenly costs SEK 4.95), you charge a fee for a reminder SMS that the parking time is running out etc. Just lots of fees for miscellaneous, what is the next step, to charge for logging in to the app maybe? Scarce and hard-to-find information, the app refers to the website's home page instead of taking one to what you are looking for. Everything is designed to make it as difficult as possible for users so that Easy Park can charge as much as possible and write as many parking fines as possible. Very disappointed and will avoid these parking lots as much as possible. A joke to companies that hopefully will not last long in my municipality.;1;2021-02-04;15.16.0;0.7897;positive

Of course you do not want to get that fee! The fact that it is then complicated with settings and that it is also difficult to interpret where you can park when you visit Malm√∂ means that the risk of parking fees is super high.

Recommends Parkster which does exactly the same thing but with no hidden fees. additional comment on answer: that it appears on the receipt after purchase is in my world a little late. Throughout the app, you do not manage to say that you have added a fee, even though there are many logical places to do it. That I would at one point pay SEK 27 to contribute to your app development is unreasonable. Try to take SEK 27 for the app in the App Store and see if anyone is willing to pay it even as a lump sum.

3200;thadvnt79;Used EasyPark's GPS positioning to find the parking lot. After the app identified exactly where I stood, I started parking. This resulted in a fine as EasyPark had marked the wrong tariff / code. They take no responsibility at all for this. I'm far from the only one who has been affected. Feel free to read other reviews and other users' experience of EasyPark on e.g. trustpilot. I see that I have received an answer from the app developer. You should be extremely aware that the information presented in the app is not as simple as the app manufacturer wants it to appear. Also, do not forget that EasyPark makes its money regardless of whether you as a user are fined or not. But that says something about a parking company whose vision is to improve "the Urban Experince" instead of having the vision to help users easily park correctly and ensure that parking fines are avoided. I want to claim that EasyPark's GPS function helps to do the opposite and there are several reviews here from people who have experienced the same thing as me. In addition, the name of the app contributes to the problem, as it is promised to be simple, but in comparison with other services, it is the direct opposite. After further answers from where you claim that you want to try to help your customers as best as possible, the statement remains that you fail with it quite often (by the way, still looking for the Gallup survey that you refer to on your website regarding customer satisfaction). And ang. If I have been in contact with your customer service, yes of course I have. At first glance, it looks like a professional answer, but for anyone who has parked at some point and then been fined, I dare say that your answer is perceived as extremely condescending. For those of you who read this review, really take a look at other people's reviews also regarding EasyPark and its app and think about whether there might not be a better alternative when you park. (For example, a company that also takes care of the fine and in this way actually has a much greater responsibility and thus better opportunities to really help parking customers than a company like EasyPark).

You have to call in every time you are going to drive another car and no one answers or you end up in a telephone queue and get a fine in the meantime, so you have to take care of it yourself.

Incidentally, the app ends up in a somewhat locked position if the parking time expires at the same time as you try to spin until a new end time.

3403;iYlva;I stand in the same entrance parking the times I park with the easypark app. Many new updates have made it better. A big disadvantage is that after you have started your parking, it is at least as easy to accidentally end it. I did. It cost me SEK 750. I am moody. In the app, you end the parking at the exact same place where you start it. You do not need to confirm that you want to end the parking elsewhere on the screen. The app may be nicer in that way, but for me it meant that after I had started the parking, I ran towards the train, threw the phone in my pocket. There in my pocket I happened to finish my parking. Unintentionally. Now the next time I parked, I checked lots of times that the parking is running. An alternative to avoid these mistakes is to close the app. But the backbone feeling says no. What happens when you shut down Netflix or Spotify ... well the movie or music ends. It's a bit the same feeling to shut down the app. What makes me feel safe with my parking not closing? There are things to improve here to avoid these mistakes. I'm not impressed because a SEK 20 parking lot cost me a fine of SEK 750 when all I wanted was to do the right thing for me.

Above all, it lacks two functions that are no longer available, or no longer work, as well as views on the spinning wheel. 1) The possibility that the app itself shows the area code, this has existed in previous versions but no longer works and now I have to go to the machine to replace the area code and manually enter this in the app. 2) The app's icon does not show ongoing parking. This is found in all other P-apps I use, e.g. SMS Park, Park in Gothenburg, Parkster and others. This has also existed here before, I want to remember as I am now disturbed by the fact that it does not exist. 3) The time setting, the spinning wheel, you get crazy about if you have to park for a long time, e.g. night parking as it may need to spin 15 laps to get the desired time. Look at how "Park in Gothenburg" has solved this for inspiration. Otherwise, thanks for a good app that got worse at point 1 & 2;3;2017-11-30;10.0.3;0.6059;positive

3553;1miffo;Since installation a year ago, I have used EasyPark many times without any problems. If there is a queue at the ticket machine, it does not matter, you just take the area number, enter it while leaving, select the vehicle you are going to park, spin on the time wheel, press start, of course. If you need more time and it is possible to extend, you can during the meeting, lunch or whatever you do extend the time by just starting the app and spinning the wheel and if you come tbx before the time runs out you can cancel the parking and in this way you pay only for the time you stand there.

It should be called "Paying and Paying and Paying Made Easy" ... because that part works pretty well. Dear Happiness-MajaIt is simply not good enough to blame the phone. When users receive fines even though they have demonstrably paid with the app, then the TOTAL SERVICE DOES NOT WORK. And everything else is just what is important to the user. It should not be difficult to understand. You should make sure that there is only one zone in each place for the location service to work.

4157;Btotheone;I have had a very unfortunate experience with the app‚Äôs registration of the location, which resulted in my parking time starting in the wrong zone and thus a parking ticket. The speed of the registration of which zone you are in, and the ease of use in that you become aware of a possible incorrect registration while you are on the go, I consider to be extremely poor compared to other parking apps. In that case, there was no question that I had left the car or that I had otherwise made a remote registration. It was just that the app had not managed to register my location correctly (despite the fact that I always give it some time when I open the app) and that I was not aware that it had not registered it correctly. The parking ticket was my mistake and therefore I paid for it, but I definitely think that the app can handle a software update that makes it faster to register the location, as it takes a long time. Again, this is alone compared to other parking apps.In addition, one could consider whether the usability of the app should be updated so that the user can not avoid seeing or getting checked that it is in the wrong zone that is registered.;1;2018-10-24;11.5;-0.7725;negative

4425;Pablocruz89;I have used easypark for a long time and also been happy with it - super smart idea, so you do not have to go and look for the parking stand !! HOWEVER, I just got a parking ticket, even though I paid for parking via easypark, BECAUSE I did not see a note that was put up on the parking stand in area 3100 !! You should give a warning that "there may be a possibility that there is a pilot project in the area you have chosen to park, and that therefore no parking is allowed" ..... Waste of money. You should give us info about this so it does not happen to others ... but otherwise great idea ...;3;2014-09-26;3.9;0.8825;positive

The surface of the app is well and neatly structured, the parking zone (code) has always been correctly recognized automatically and operation is intuitive. So far everything works perfectly, the recommendation of the possible parking space finding fits as far as possible. The EasyPark stickers (for the windshield) for 2 cars arrived promptly and are free of charge. Points are deducted due to the poor pricing. Either you take the overpriced subscription or pay a 15% surcharge on the parking price for occasional use. I paid ‚Ç¨ 3.97 in addition to the parking price of ‚Ç¨ 4.04 (‚Ç¨ 8.01 total) for a parking time of 1.5 hours. That's not exactly a snap.

4985;Barandur;The transaction fees are very often extremely high in relation to the parking fee, actually usury !!!Alternatively, take a look at the provider ParkNow! There are fees with every transaction! That in itself is completely understandable. The provider has to finance itself somehow, since the actual parking fee has to be paid back to the city. At easypark, these transaction fees can either be fixed and independent of the parking fees or they depend on the parking fee, which is the case in most of the parking zones at easypark! In the latter variant, the transaction fee can be very, very expensive!In Berlin, for example, it is 15% of the parking fee, but at least ‚Ç¨ 0.49 !!!49 cents is only 15% from a parking fee of around ‚Ç¨ 3.27!In Berlin, one hour usually costs ‚Ç¨ 1!So I would have to park for almost 3.5 hours so that I really only pay 15% of the parking fee as a transaction fee! From then on it becomes more and more expensive with the transaction fee!There are also parking zones in Berlin, where you pay ‚Ç¨ 2 per hour from 6pm to midnight. The 15% transaction fee for easypark is worthwhile from 1:45 a.m. parking time! Because from then on the transaction fee rises continuously! If I also consider that I often only park somewhere for half an hour for 50 cents, then the transaction fee is almost 100% of the parking fee and that's really bold! What actually happens if I want to extend the parking time? Do I then pay at least 49 cents again? There is another way:At ParkNow you only pay 25 cents per bookingor alternatively ‚Ç¨ 2.99 / month without charge per booking.1.67 That is why easypark only gets 1 star!;1;2019-02-23;12.5;0.7992;positive

4988;geplagter Handyparkkunde;Somebody was probably not paying attention and implemented the design draft of a nine-year-old girl without thinking too much. Even minor updates keep changing the UI, with a clear tendency "confusing" and "even more pink". Obvious activities such as setting the parking time etc. are hidden behind overloaded, pink rotary controls which, when cranking, also like to trigger a paid parking process at the same time. It has to look for Easter eggs first (yes, where could it be this time) and then a gambling component, great! Therefore, in case the gentlemen should have forgotten: The minimal task was a digital parking ticket. But they preferred to build an annoying app that repeatedly forces unexpected user interaction. _Everything_ shines really well with a lot of blingbling - just howling when you look at the average parking meter as an alternative. It seems to be particularly important to the current crew to display unexpected and pointless comments between the customers and the start of the parking process. Yesterday I had to talk to the policewoman for a long time because a parking process was ultimately not started. The app really wanted to tell me modally that I needed such a sticker in the car. Oh no, great thanks: I've been a "mobile phone parking customer" for 10+ years, and thus probably have a much longer business relationship with the company than most of my developers there. But I didn't know that I needed a sticker as a reference for the Zettelhex ... I'm curious when I will be told that cats cannot be dried in the microwave. Honestly, hopefully it will be something else, otherwise I'll switch back to change and parking machines, it doesn't sting so much in the eyes and it hurts a lot less behind the forehead.;1;2017-12-15;10.2;0.9731;positive

4990;harre63;I installed the app with great pleasure and am a committed user. Alone the crooked amounts (89 cents, 1.51 ‚Ç¨, ...) surprised me a bit - on the other hand: is a minute-by-minute billing ... The push notification then only says ‚ÄúTotal costs ‚Ç¨ 0.89. It was completely clear to me: these are the pure parking fees. So far so good, until I asked for an invoice. And lo and behold: in addition to the parking fee, I am charged 12 cents in transaction costs for each transaction. This is not shown or displayed anywhere (neither in the app store, on the website, nor anywhere else). If it is somewhere and I haven't found it, I beg your forbearance, at least I haven't found anything despite an intensive search. It is also interesting when you request the invoice for a transaction: Then you get the message that ‚Äúthe invoice will be sent automatically on the day of the debit‚Äù. Of course I checked that and as expected, an invoice never came on the day of the debit ... Only now, at the moment when I requested the invoice, it came to my email account by return post. Conclusion: I have nothing against service fees, because "what costs nothing is not worth" or collects data. BUT: To raise fees and not to present them transparently or to mark them in any other way is not possible for me and therefore, in my opinion, this is just modern highway robbery.;1;2020-02-02;14.8;0.8928;positive

The possibility of saving the parking zone code and selecting it later from a list was particularly helpful. In Berlin there are areas where you park your car and look for the machine with a taxi. The parking zone memory was simply great! But then there was an update, everything should get better. Instead of the last parking zone, you now read a sequence of digits that of course has nothing to do with the correct code.Well, I reported it to easypark, a total of three times, they promised a correction soon, but nobody said when it would be soon.;4;2012-07-25;2.0;0.9233;positive

The "spatial independence" from the vehicle is particularly good. I can control the parking process from any location that has access to mobile communications or the Internet - I don't have to be at the vehicle. The free phone number is also very good if the parking process is to be processed over the phone. The ease of use (both with the phone and the app) is also good - if you have got used to a few specific terms. E.g. "complete the parking process" means that the parking is ended - more clearly would be "end the parking process". Is only a small example and does not limit the absolutely positive evaluation.

With travipay you only pay 14 cents per parking transaction. To my great surprise, I also found that you can park with travipay in Hamburg and in many other cities. All in all, that even seems more to me than at EasyPark.

5059;KMBmike;The app works perfectly so far, but I installed it to save costs on short-term parking, but it doesn't work at all.Here with us, for example, half an hour of parking costs 90 cents if you insert a coin (this is also the minimum amount at the parking meters).If I enter this parking time into the app, i.e. 30 minutes (or less, e.g. 10 minutes), easyPark charges ‚Ç¨ 1.36. Extending the parking time to the minute only works to a limited extent, so in the app yes, but there are big leaps in terms of costs, which are ALWAYS more expensive than inserting coins. Despite the inside window sticker and paid parking time, a parking attendant also wanted to issue a parking ticket, which I saw in time. When I referred to the sticker, he just shrugged my shoulders ... so when parking time is activated, the app also says that you should put a note in the car ... then what is the inside window sticker good for?O.k., if you don't have any change at hand, then the app may make sense, therefore 2 stars, otherwise I recommend change, firstly it is generally cheaper and secondly you avoid misunderstandings with the park attendants.The app would be REALLY useful, among other things, only if it would charge correspondingly little, especially for short-term parking of e.g. 10 minutes, and not even charge more than you have to pay for half an hour by inserting a coin.;2;2016-01-22;5.2;0.9676;positive

At Easypark, I have to decide in advance how long I want to park, using a completely coarse and cumbersome dial. I miss to extend - bad luck. Pay again. Mobile City had a widget that let you quickly call up the ongoing parking process from the lockscreen. At Easy Park? Nothing.

OK, PDF and its data will serve business customers, etc. with accounting, etc. For us in the way of walkers, it is enough to see the date and price. Opening a pdf and digging data from there is frustrating and annoying. In other words, put the date of parking and the total price in the text section of the email.

169;Risto M√§kinen;I have been pleased with the EasyPark parking app. For example, when I go to the reception in Jorvi, I don't know how long it will take and then I'll put at least 4 hours. Usually I survive an hour and the app charges just the amount of time as long as you remember to stop it when you get in the car. There has also been a situation before the corona in the parking lot next to the Opera, where in the rain I have charged the parking time in peace in the car when there is a long queue in the rain in front of the field parking meter. Sometimes there is a bit of searching for the area number and it has to check the area parking meter sticker.;5;2020-11-15;15.13.1;0.3818;neutral

1453;SPQR today;Decent app for outstanding idea of paying for parking with your phone. Not for short parkings though due to expensive starting charges. Could notify about end of parking through push messages as well as SMS.  The UX of the app could see lots of improvement. The app loads slowly on 4S and selecting the area and car (if you have more than one) is also slow and takes several ignored taps at worst. Usually you are in a bit of a hurry while parking which makes UI delays even more annoying.;4;2014-05-27;3.6.3;-0.3384;neutral

I suggest a feature for the app that stops the "base charge" for example when the app is not used for two weeks.  Another great feature is location. When you drive into EasyPark's parking area, the app reports a parking ID based on location (area 301, will parking be started?).

1580;Jan Erlend Garshol;There is still a lot that should be improved on this app. But it is probably the best parking app anyway. And just get used to this way of parking. For example, if you use automatic sign reading, you must make sure that parking is stopped when exiting. There have been a lot of calls to the parking companies to stop and start parking.

A good point - which I constantly inform others, who will be installing the parking app for the first time - is that this app works in all parking lots. In addition, EasyPark is so unorthodox when it comes to customer service that you get alerts well in advance of the parking. The app is, of all the apps on my mobile, the one that never crashes.;5;2021-07-20;15.23.0;0.7003;positive

Easy park sends an invoice and it can arrive six months later and if you forget it, then it will be expensive for you. Recommends everyone to pay directly at the vending machines. In any case, you must always pay while you are at the car. It says easyparks regulations.;1;2015-11-07;5.1;0.7357;positive

Also avoid P-company parking traps where there is no information in the App that tells users about max. Parking time in that zone or a limit to max. Parking time. You can pay to EasyPark for 5-10 hours for a parking zone where you are ONLY allowed to park 0.5 hours. When you could also extend the parking time via mobile, which in certain cases exceeds the max.

3037;brianrkf;EDIT: Thanks for your cheeky response, EasyPark Team. Unfortunately it was their app that made the mistake and not me, that's why I'm very annoyed. I chose the right zone (without time limit), have extended parking 2 times and the app only ended parking 25 minutes early, without any error message or without me doing anything to control the app to end parking‚Ä¶ Do not know what customer service will help me with then. Should I send you a signed confirmation from 3 family members who saw me extend the parking? I can try, then I can share my experience with other users here!  If there is any "hidden", illogical or unintuitive way to end parking that I was not made aware of in advance (as other 1-star reviewers here point out), then it is again just bad design in their app. Users can not read developers' thoughts.  ‚Äî-  The app confirmed 2 TIMES that I have demanded parking from 12:15 to 12:30 and then to 12:45, still I was fined NOK 600 because the parking was closed by itself at. 12.25, have no idea why‚Ä¶ I simply feel cheated!

The app is not very user-friendly and does not notify properly. Parking can be interrupted or never started for no reason even if it says it is running. Only the hub is so jargon that every sensible person should stay away. Change the name to "Park at your own risk" And when you talk to support, they will not understand that something is wrong. The customer has all responsibility and it is of course the customer who made the mistake and who thus has to pay a fine :-( Should uninstall the app immediately and warn everyone I meet.;1;2021-06-22;15.22.0;-0.7517;negative

Easypark dismisses and believes users need to read The Little Scriptures better. Many users have also complained that Easypark pulls for the same parking several times. I am one of them. Again, the developer rejects everything as a user error.  I myself immediately contacted customer service when the app notified me that my parking was about to expire - several days after I had purchased a 24-hour parking. But here I could thank myself. The developer maintains that I as a user must understand that active 24-hour parking does not appear on the app's opening page, as other parking does, and that the user must orient themselves in the submenus, find out if Easypark has charged the user for more than one day, and then take contact customer service before the first 24 hours have passed.

Now it turns out that someone who borrowed the car a few months ago naturally put it in the app to pay for parking, and that is the reason why we are not allowed to use the app. Suggestions for developers: Write more informative error messages than type "Error.Message.11341". A message like "2 other people have added this car to their app. It can be in an app at most" would have been very helpful. If possible, allow several people to enter the same car, with camera parking activated. If that's not possible, let me see which other users have put the same car in the app, with phone number.

3212;Vilde S. Jensen;Hi! The app is very handsome and light-hearted, really useful for a busy everyday life! One thing I think could have been an improvement is this with the choice of car and registration number. Here it is very easy to make mistakes as a user, which for me and many others has resulted in a fine - despite the fact that you have actually paid, but for a registration number that does not exist or a car that was obviously not in the parking lot. One idea could be to have a two-step registration of car numbers, so that it is easier to detect errors in registration if these two do not match. Or possibly a check against a register, which means that the registration number that does not exist is not approved by the app, and checks if the first two letters are in the registration number at all. Personally, I missed "f" and pressed "r" in a hurry - and "NR" does not exist. But the cure was there, because this was my fault, which I agree with! (Despite the fact that I think the parking attendant should have looked for the car he had paid for, and not found this, and then looked between his fingers and thought "here is someone who has been human to misprint in the app".) By improving it I have mentioned above, I think the app would be more "foolproof" and even more would have enjoyed and trusted the app, and that parking attendants do not have to take the brunt of the user's mistakes - which is often awkward to admit as a user :);3;2019-03-03;12.6;0.9737;positive

I think the developer should fix this as people may think they have valid parking and get fines.

There are several vending machines near each other and the app is just as happy to give you one that does not belong to the parking lot you are in. Once I was parked with several people, I had paid correctly but three friends were fined for their cars next to mine because they had paid at the wrong vending machine I have now been fined myself because I have relied on the app in stress. I have done everything right but have paid for an appliance that was a little further away and not for what belonged to my parking lot.

But a parking area without a visible border that separates two different parking spaces is in my opinion relatively meaningless (still profitable for you :-)) The correct parking space was less than 10 meters away from my parked car and should mainly cost me 12kr. 7 minutes later - 612kr.

3274;J√∏mle;Using the App costs 15% more than paying with, for example, a card at the machine. Information about this extra cost is given in VERY small print on the information poster by the parking meter (has one picture from the machine at location 7127 in √Ölesund as an example, but may not attach it as an appendix in this review). It is important to be aware that the surcharge of 15% gives a significant additional cost for parking over a longer period of time. When using, for example, payment by card at a vending machine, parking can also be terminated earlier so that the use of the app does not provide any cost savings (unless you temporarily drive in / out of the car park during your stay and want to end parking payment for the period you are out. parked for more than 10 hours per day, you should still pay for one day and then there is not necessarily any savings when using the app .... maybe rather the opposite);2;2018-09-04;11.2.1;0.5023;positive

3282;dpkra;This app costs me a parking fine because it took the wrong code for the parking place. It lacks a proper check for what you type in for parking code. The parking code of 3 or four digits are prone to mistakes in typing and complaining to easypark does not help as they are not the one renting out the parking lot. Easypark is not interested to improve the app as Europark makes more money with errors of the user. Strongly recommend to write these complaints so that the app gets improved. Parking lot codes should not be very similar. I had to type 9445 (Sandnes) but easypark app registered 944, which was a parking lot in Oslo.  Called immediately when I saw the fine in the window of my car. Everybody makes typing errors on the mobilphone. The software should be better and only a numeric keyboard should be given (similar when I use the Bank ID on my phone) to reduce the change on typing errors.  Finally do not use this app. Please boycot it until improved. My comments to Easyparc should be valued the 600kr fine!!  The answer of Easyparc is that they all have 4 digit codes. I am 100% sure that I did not type 0944. How can then 944 be written on the historic confirmation of my payment. See for yourself!  Good luck with your Appüëé;1;2018-08-28;11.2.1;0.9665;positive

Could the pressure continue, but not sure if I had done something wrong, there was payment with coin this time as well  Proposed solution  How about having your own functionality for a rental car. Put the car in a time-limited period (because you do not want it on your list) called rental car (or borrowed car). Ask when it is entered which country it is registered in, and verify the sign against this country.

See that you have previously answered other comments here, that it should come back at the end of January. I can not find it.  Then I have to say that I am skeptical that customers have to pay you 15% of the parking fee. It is in the highest team. If you know of other digital solutions (eg bus), you get a discount for buying a ticket digitally.

3342;Xystein;Hi  Thank you for giving us an easier everyday life with parking, I would like to see it become even easier, for example with auto-registration if you park in a zone that supports this. iPhone already tells me where I have parked so would think it was possible to connect to this on an if. Especially for free zones.  After praise and suggestions, there will be some rice. You now have 2 ¬´buttons for search, it's just clutter. Let's look up both addresses and code in the same interface, search is search.   You should also find a more elegant way to take charge or inform better.

3593;interfacedesigner;I downloaded and used the parking app Easy Park. As it appears from the app, I left a note visible with "Easy park" written in the car until the wafer arrived by post. I used the app's location service to find the tariff group. I do not know the exact address where I parked and chose the rate group that resembled the parking lot. All offered tariff groups gathered different types of parking, of which 2 out of three were entitled "Garage" and I consequently chose "Street parking" instead since I was parked outdoors. As it appears from my history, I have paid for hours and expensively for the place, but by using the place service I have chosen the wrong rate group. The guard who imposed the fine on me did not know about "Easy park", despite the fact that he imposed fines on the area, nor did he take the time to check surrounding tariff groups if this car had paid. To closely analyze offered tariff group titles or memorize a multi-digit tariff group digit readable but undercommunicated a good distance away at the vending machine, when a location service on a mobile (!) App is offered, is not ok. When complaining, Easy Park points out that one should read the terms of the app closely, and they do not go back on the fine even though they can see that I have paid. This is an app with helpless appraisal categories that make you dependent on precise address knowledge and that you go to the machine to double check. On top of this, the company has lousy customer service, and a poorly managed collaboration with EuroPark which imposes the fines.;1;2013-11-15;3.3.1;-0.2876;neutral

After you finally finish (again) you can use the app. It works well, but has potential for improvement. What about scanning the regnr, lookup of place based on postal code, or pre-filling based on lookup on telephone number / birth number?  It also adds quite hefty - enables server communication in background processes instead of better ux.  The "Give us feedback" form does not work. Nothing happens. Slightly ironic ...

3662;TorsteinHyl;I love the easypark concept, and use it regularly at work.

Have never got the correct zone number by pressing the "nearby" button, possibly I have only had bad luck with the places I parked, but it does not work the first five times the threshold is a bit high to give it more chances. Fortunately, it has become easier to spin to the exact times after the previous update, so they should be praised for listening to feedback. That said, can not quite put my finger on why it is an app I dislike, maybe it's just a design thing ...;4;2013-03-10;3.0.9;0.7396;positive

3675;RihannaGirl;EasyPark is a bit more expensive (15%), but means that as long as the phone is with you do not need money or a Visa card. You receive a text message 15 minutes before the parking time expires, and can thus extend the time from the dentist's chair or where it should be.

3679;Bardoien;Undoubtedly the future way of paying for parking. Drag a wheel to set the time, and press the stop button when done. The greed that drives the parking lot is in this way cheated for the excess pennies. When you do not arrive on time, you just spin the wheel a little longer. Hopefully, you will thus avoid that nuffe-nuff on commission spews yellow patches across your route more contrary to what you have stood for a minute over time. Here, the industry largely cannibalizes itself. Beautiful to look at, but also feels good for the wallet.;5;2013-01-26;3.0;0.3315;neutral

I got an answer today and during the day and after a reinstall today it works again! Brilliant!! Also get a receipt on sms !! Now only GPS function is missing so the app gets top marks from me !!  Previous mention: I use EasyPark diligently and have saved large amounts on parking. Arguments that it costs a lot to use EasyPark do not hold if you park a lot and for example are a lot in meetings with a somewhat uncertain end time. EasyPark is an ingenious solution and the app worked well to begin with, but for far (!) Long now it has not worked properly. I wrote an email to EasyPark about this several months ago where they replied that they are working hard to fix this. It turns out (obviously) that is not true. The concept is ingenious. Had the app worked, it would also have been ingenious, but now I only use the ring solution until further notice.

3771;juan carlos rodrigo;App that desistalo, before it had epark that became easypark, starting to charge fees for parking in Madrid.

Finally, the 10% recharge seems excessive to me. In short, I would not mind paying a surcharge if at least the app will work well and more intuitively.

I consider that you should have the option to cancel the time if the parking time is not used and that they only charge you for what is used. I also recommend that if the time expires and you want to put the car parked in the same place again, it gives you the option to renew it without having to look for the car on the map.

4003;Victor M.;All wrong: - It is chosen for time, instead of money. With e-park you chose the amount to spend, and the app indicated the maximum time. In this other way, sometimes you pay the same for a certain time as for the same plus five minutes. - Minimum commission of 18 cents per ticket. Even if the ticket is for a couple of cents. In other apps like Telpark it is 3 cents (in Madrid). - It does not allow to eliminate the means of payment if you do not put another one. - There is no way to delete your own account.;1;2021-07-04;15.23.0;-0.4149;neutral

They charge you a minimum of 15ct (it can be clearer) for each parking. The developer responds that epark was just a digital parking meter personally what I was looking for. I will spend the credit I bring from epark, if I can get through it, and then uninstall and forget about the easypark family. I update. I'm going to ELPARKING.;1;2021-05-26;15.15.1;0.0772;neutral

It is not intuitive. It does not report on the new conditions, or it does so in a cryptic way. It does not allow confirmation of parking, so if a mistake is made, either by the user or by the application, there is no going back. Yesterday I was testing the application from my home, since I had to go to Madrid an hour and a half later. He tells me at 5:50 p.m. that I am parked, and that it ended at 7:19 p.m. without giving the option to confirm, I called by phone and there was no way to go back. They blamed the City Council. And to me the anger for not reading the conditions I have entered the application several times and there is no way. It is possible that I am stupid, as they came to suggest, but as I see from the opinions, there are many of us. It is possible that the application is only for gifted people, so I will unsubscribe as soon as the claim that I have filed with the City Council is resolved. In the end I parked at twenty past six with the uncertainty of the possibility that four hours would pass and end up sanctioned. Fortunately, it was not. In short, a disaster.

4609;Lorien H;Not very intuitive when adding the payment method since where you must add it first, a website will appear to pay the fine. When paying for the parkmeter you must do it by location. Once the active ticket is over, you must locate where the car was to pay for another period of time, while you are already away from the car. With epark everything was easier.

5086;josedx01;A disaster: you have to mark the street where you park and it is very easy to cancel your parking inadvertently. That is if the pasta is not returned to you. The first time I used it, I mistakenly canceled a payment of ‚Ç¨ 1.3 within seconds of making it. The solution: pay 1.3 ‚Ç¨ again. I said, a garbage infects application. By the way, I don't live in Madrid. I live in Coru√±a. And once you give it to cancel, the solution so that you don't get fined is to pay again. I said, an application scam. For my part, now I pay in cash. Hopefully with that I collaborate so that this garbage is loaded;1;2021-08-30;15.26.0;-0.7159;negative

Apart from the higher prices, the gigantic button where the time is chosen is badly thought out. You have to turn the wheel to mark the time and one millimeter away is the "Start Parking" button, so it is extremely easy to hit it by mistake. And if you have fallen short, great, but if you spend time, because you were still adjusting it, too bad. To overpay. Furthermore, in Madrid you cannot stop parking. So, you hang on and EasyPark wins a little more with your mistake. I want to think that this button is badly designed and not done with all the intention.

5117;Trezene;The old app was much better, easier to use, without the possibility of activating anything that you did not want!  Now, when you hit the wheel to choose the time, you have to be very fine because you still haven't set the parking time you need, but accidentally when you turn you give it to start. Which is right in the center ... the same thing happens to cancel, you can do it without wanting to!  It would not be bad if I asked you for CONFIRMATION before either of those two actions. Or they put the buttons elsewhere, or a less complicated system than turning the wheel to select the duration of your parking ... Anything I can think of is better than this.  In my city the blue zone ends at 9:00 p.m., but the app allows you to pay all night .....  To top it off, prices have risen ... I'm afraid I'm going back to coins!

It is not easily found, although it is, the car parks in progress. In addition, it does not indicate the time at which it is no longer necessary to pay (in other applications it jumps directly to the next day) which leads to confusion.

I feel cheated!! Exactly that has happened to me, not being able to cancel the parking made by mistake, because there is no button for it, I wrote an email to the customer service email, telling them what happened and attaching data and a screenshot. They have called me by phone (which I appreciate), and the answer is that "in Madrid they cannot cancel or cancel errors, because the city council does not allow them that option."  I understand that the city council can set some rules, but if so, then EasyPark should change the current design of the payment mode (at least in Madrid, put separate buttons for selecting time and payment) so that it is not so easy to make the mistake to pay for a parking that you do not want to do or for the unwanted time. Otherwise, it will seem that they want to take advantage of all those charges committed by mistake.  I will report both the app and the city council to the consumer office, because I honestly think it is a real scam towards users and customers.

In ePark, at 9 pm he was already jumping the next day. After that, he won't let you put on until 9:00 p.m. It must be at 8:59 p.m. If you get caught by one of traffic that minute you get a safe fine because that last minute is not covered.

Geolocation is a nuisance, it consumes a lot of battery and if you don't want to activate it, it makes you waste time locating your car on the map and you risk being fined if you don't define it correctly. To top it off, there is no confirm parking button, so if you get lost, you can pay for parking involuntarily as it happened to me. In short, I can't think of any reason to keep using it.
