988;Timo Lehti;Parking in Helsinki and Tampere has been much easier. That is, with coins and parking tickets fluttering. In addition, the parking time can be extended with a few clicks. Easy to set up: an app for your phone and a parkman sticker on the windshield. When approaching the parking area, turn on the phone's gps and parkman app to rotate. When a parking space is found, it chooses the parking time in hours and minutes ... There really have not been any parking fines with Parkman.;5;2016-01-02;3.19;0.6908;positive

1017;Jouni Aho;Currently version 3.16 and it works and I use and I am almost happy. At some point in the updates, the choice of parking time became the choice of end time to the nearest hour and minute. In the old one, only the length of the parking time from this moment onwards was chosen x hours / minutes. AND IT WAS CONVENIENT! Now you have to look at what the clock is and adjust the end time hours and minutes separately. May be suitable for rapper fans but not for me. When this change came, I immediately sent feedback and suggested that you could choose which feature to use from the menu. There was a green light that this could be done - sometimes. Not done yet! Convenient app by the way, but only 3 stars due to the rapping of the P-time expiration time! * * * Application startup is interrupted by a message stating that the process com.neligrate.parkman stopped unexpectedly. Reinstallation and booting your phone between installation attempts and application removals will not help. Samsung Xcover GT-S5690 and Android version 2.3.6. The old app version worked flawlessly and wants it back from something !! Thank you! Follow the instructions to install Google Play Service.;3;2015-11-23;3.16;0.5973;positive

The small disadvantage comes from the long positioning time and the fact that the service fee per parking is 0.49 euros, which was not announced in the software in advance. It‚Äôs now a small amount of money from the hassle of not having to carry cash along and not having to walk to the parking lot and back to the car. I'm satisfied.;4;2013-09-12;2.14;0.6478;positive

895;Millariina V;There was an advertisement for the application on the ATM: First parking is free with a code. I didn‚Äôt have any coins, so I downloaded the app to take advantage of the offer. After installation, it turned out that the app could not be used until the billboard arrived in the mail and I glued it to the windshield. So you didn't get free parking right away. The car was borrowed from a friend, so the sticker can‚Äôt be glued anyway without asking. In addition, the parking time started immediately by accident, which means that free parking was wasted.;1;2016-06-19;3.21;0.4211;neutral

1017;Jouni Aho;Currently version 3.16 and it works and I use and I am almost happy. At some point in the updates, the choice of parking time became the choice of end time to the nearest hour and minute. In the old one, only the length of the parking time from this moment onwards was chosen x hours / minutes. AND IT WAS CONVENIENT! Now you have to look at what the clock is and adjust the end time hours and minutes separately. May be suitable for rapper fans but not for me. When this change came, I immediately sent feedback and suggested that you could choose which feature to use from the menu. There was a green light that this could be done - sometimes. Not done yet! Convenient app by the way, but only 3 stars due to the rapping of the P-time expiration time! * * * Application startup is interrupted by a message stating that the process com.neligrate.parkman stopped unexpectedly. Reinstallation and booting your phone between installation attempts and application removals will not help. Samsung Xcover GT-S5690 and Android version 2.3.6.

That is, if you park with Parkman in a foreign city, you still have to get out of the car and look for a parking meter to find out what is in question. the correct name of the parking area to make sure the app has actually located you in the right place.

1754;DHawku;I was charging Parkman for lack of coins one night when I arrived at the hotel when 10e free parking money was promised on a billboard on the meter. I arrived at the parking lot at night, when there was free parking on the meter until eight, but I thought I would sleep a couple of hours longer. I then stabbed the machine, and at night when I got off when paid parking would start. I stabbed the watch for a couple of hours. As it were, in the morning when I woke up very rested, the parking clock had spun the bill at night. During free parking. The couple of hours of parking had expired in that four countries at night, meaning the parking lot could have come to leave souvenirs. In addition, the ‚Ç¨ 10 subscription money had disappeared from my appis without leaving a trace, so this became a credit card bill. Yep, the sign-up money, which was still recorded with the promotional code when registering, disappeared before even the first parking had been completed. (Or I paid ‚Ç¨ 13 for basically two hours of free overnight parking, which is an even more daunting option.) Nowhere, of course, was it mentioned that the program would not follow the parking meter times set by the city. Really confusing experience, not to continue. I got some sort of company parking sticker in the mail a couple of weeks later, an invoice three weeks after the event that picked up this review from my pen. Coins in the car will henceforth, as long as the user experience is in order, the subscription fee will remain in the account and any billing criteria that differ from the vending machines will be clearly listed.;1;2015-03-02 20:00:29;2.6.5;0.8206;positive

1798;Pekka Nikander;Convenient, easy to pay parking. I think the current interface is quite functional, as opposed to what someone else has complained about in the past. Sometimes the database contains incorrect information about the place's fee, for example, one Saturday in Hakaniemi, the application thought that parking is free even though it was paid. I paid for ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù 0-priced parking, i.e. the service fee was 49c, I didn‚Äôt pay for the parking itself. I don‚Äôt know what would have happened if the lizards had visited. Because the payment always goes according to the time spent, sometimes the parking itself becomes cheaper with the service fee than when paying with coins. In fact, I rarely park in paid places, so I‚Äôm happy to pay for the convenience of the app. The new version now comes with a maximum time for parking to end. If the phone runs out of battery, for example, I understand that parking will end then. Complicates a bit of the previous interface, making it a place for development.;4;2014-06-02 19:35:01;2.5.9;0.7414;positive

So you switch to your Photo app, make a note of the license plate, and switch back to ParkMan. But instead of remembering where it was, the ParkMan app now starts all over again. The app also does not support Android multi-window function, so you can not "pin" the photo of your license plate while entering in the app. These are not advanced features, these are quite basic things that every Android developer encounters in the first book on Android development.

2141;S√∏ren Dinesen;ParkMan has sent me to debt collection twice within the last month for a bill of 118 which has been paid.How it is possible to owe ParkMan money in the first place is a mystery to me as they withdraw the money on the credit card before you can park.I have been one of the first users 8-10 years ago and have otherwise been happy with ParkMan but now I am scared because they do not have control over their customer base and app.For example, ParkMan has sent emails with reminders and fees to a 10-year-old e-mail that has not been used for the last 6 years (stated from intrum debt collection)Wow - what a mess.Therefore, I can only recommend users to withdraw from their crockery.
