8;Marika Savolainen;Continuing the running out of parking time, the app located my parking fee in the wrong area and started a new parking. I didn’t even realize to check it out when I used to work well. For this reason I got a parking fine !!!! Leaving the app for exchange !!;1;2021-09-29;15.17.1

19;Ville Laaksonen;Today, with this app, we get more money invested in parking. So Easy pays us for the family's quality time together. Vautsi Wau !! Can this be true when it is so awesome, for example in the center of Helsinki for only 5 euros / hour !!;2;2021-09-17;15.26.0

28;Mika Kyrönlahti;It saves money in concrete terms! Just remember to put enough time right at the start of parking. The park can be conveniently cut off if necessary, so no money is wasted.;5;2021-09-08;15.25.0

32;Topi;It’s pretty easy to miss if you’ve put in a fair amount of parking time and don’t remember to stop in between. Does not show any icon that the application is on on the phone. Otherwise quite convenient.;3;2021-09-01;15.26.0
33;Esa Karvinen;Very good parking app.;4;2021-09-01;15.26.0
34;Juho Tammisto;There will be no more notifications when parking time is approaching or when it has already expired. After the last update, the notifications stopped working. I haven't changed the settings and the app says the notifications should still be on;1;2021-08-31;15.26.0

55;Juha Pihlman;You have to be very careful with this. The app automatically stops parking prematurely. Of course, the company does not take responsibility for this. Reviews when reading, so especially the Android version combined with one plus phone is most obviously a risk combination.;1;2021-08-13;15.17

64;Richard Andersson;Yes, it makes parking easier. The best feature is ending that time yourself + stopping parking.;4;2021-08-08;15.25.0
65;antti kaipainen;Easy to use and deploy. However, paid parking areas are not up to date and cause it to be uncomfortable to leave the car in that area. So the sign is installed but there is no area in the application.;5;2021-08-06;15.24.1

77;Eero Kemppainen;Works. Now parking is easy.;5;2021-07-29;15.24.1
78;Raimo Virtanen;After years of using Easypark, the program always worked, now after the latest updates it can't find a single parking area code. All your phone Anroid 10 with the latest updates. For example, all the Map programs worked, but this stopped working, reinstalling and going through the settings didn't help. I ask for an urgent correction.;1;2021-07-24;15.24.1
79;Seppo Helenius;Active.;4;2021-07-23;15.24.1
80;Auli Kela;Very easy. You leave the car, spin the puck (in the app) for time and that’s it. If necessary, you put more time, and if you return to the car earlier, you decide to park on the same puck. You only pay for real time. You can add cars and use in multiple locations. One application can do it! Top 👍🏻. Yes, and you can get it if you want.;5;2021-07-22;15.24.0

92;Robert Bern;Great app! I have been using it for at least a couple of years. Locates the car quickly and accurately (faster than a Google map), a clear interface with no ads, and even reminded you of the expiration date of the debit card attached to it. Able to remotely with a cell phone to increase parking time even if even delayed by some things. I recommend!;5;2021-06-23;15.19.0

105;Jorma Peltonen;Piece of cake;4;2021-05-24;15.21.0
106;Reetta Ohtonen;On the other hand, the app is good, but why should parking end time be put at the start of parking when you may not know when parking will end.🤔 Couldn’t there be a running time? You only mark when parking starts and time runs until you stop parking yourself ...;3;2021-05-18;15.20.0
107;Antti Laakso;Cuts off parking prematurely. Android and Easypark app both updated to the latest version, but no effect. Phone OnePlus Nord 5g.;1;2021-05-17;15.21.0
108;Taina Kovamäki;I used to have an easypark app before, but then I uninstalled when there was no car. Now I just recharged, after buying a car and it was nice to note that the mobilepay opportunity had come. In the past, the app worked well, I think to this day. I recommend;4;2021-05-16;15.21.0

114;Mika Havimäki;Easy and comprehensive;5;2021-04-12;15.13.1
115;Yeni Tamm;The map locator cannot be trusted. Fines come when the app places you on the wrong side of a parking lot that is actually owned by another owner. So ALWAYS use a numeric code, not a map.;3;2021-04-09;15.19.0
116;Pauli Peitola;Easy interface, convenient!;4;2021-04-09;15.19.0
117;Hanne Muurinen;A very handy app, no need to bother with tickets. The software could be developed with the heads in mind so that the program cuts off parking when the location of the car changes more than the amount of gps sway. I also inadvertently paid for parking in the free supermarket park, as well as in the backyard when I had forgotten to stop parking when I left the toll booth. 🤦🏻‍♀️🙈;4;2021-04-07;15.19.0
118;Anna S;Too bad you can't give minus stars. Full wolf. Cannot be used when unable to log in. Open the "home page" with the option to REGISTER only and not log in at all. When I enter my phone number at my registration point, I get an error message that EasyPark is already registered for this phone number.;1;2021-04-05;15.16.0_rc2
119;Susanna Salonen;The application works and not a snippet;5;2021-03-27;15.18.0

129;Jari Salminen;The best of the parking applications currently in use ... 👍😎;5;2021-02-25;15.16.0_rc2
130;Timo Karjalainen;Oddly enough, it makes the commuter's daily life easier, but could it also be possible to indicate the traditional time (e.g. a drop-down menu) in addition to that wheel? Reporting 5 days of continuous positioning required quite a bit of finger exercise ...;4;2021-02-23;15.17
131;Jouko Väätämöinen;Good. Functional and easy to use. Two years in use and never disappointed. I recommend 🤗;5;2021-02-21;15.16.0_rc2
132;Ville Salomäki;The interface doesn't tell you how much Easypark pulls in between, which is a surprising amount. The receipt also costs € 0.15.;1;2021-02-08;15.16.0_rc2

138;Hans Huhtio;Automatic camera detection does not work. Parking must be selected from the application itself.;3;2020-12-21;15.14.1
139;Tuula Vuorinen;The application is unreliable. The phone will display messages that parking has started, even if parking is not in progress. You can get parking fines even if everything seems to be fine. I do not recommend the app. You cannot get proper help from customer service in a situation where you are trying to solve a problem. Plus, customer service is incredibly rude.;1;2020-12-12;15.14.1

143;Kyösti Frestadius;Easy Park has made parking easy on the stadium. It is easy to use and quickly available. No more payment cards or other fiddling required. The application tells you if there are, for example, deviating time restrictions and also the future parking fee. I have been very satisfied. Thank you!;5;2020-12-08;15.14.1

147;Jaana Huurros;Otherwise good, but you have to start looking for a parking space from Africa, if you didn't immediately notice the parking space number. Then zoom in to Finland. In other apes, positioning works.;4;2020-11-25;15.13.1

152;Paula Nevala;Easy to use and always works. I recommend.;5;2020-11-19;15.13.1
153;Petri Mäkilä;Mainly good. Comprehensive works, generally easy to use and "the provision is reasonable, as compared to prepaid parking saves extra fees compared to prepaid parking spaces. Unfortunately, there is little card valid in parking garages, for example in Tampere you have to have a different app and somewhere else a third app when Easypark is not working. , so I don't know why it 's in. Because I don't always connect even what happened in the same parking lot, for the most part I've been happy though.;4;2020-11-18;13.3.1

167;Mika Louko;After using the app for years, it always worked flawlessly. Easy and clear interface.;5;2020-11-15;15.12.3
168;Kari Koskela;Works great for power. One improvement ... the date of parking and price information already as a receipt in the text of incoming mail. OK, PDF and its data will serve business customers, etc. with accounting, etc. For us in the way of walkers, it is enough to see the date and price. Opening a pdf and digging data from there is frustrating and annoying. In other words, put the date of parking and the total price in the text section of the email. THANK YOU!;4;2020-11-15;15.13.1
169;Risto Mäkinen;I have been pleased with the EasyPark parking app. For example, when I go to the reception in Jorvi, I don't know how long it will take and then I'll put at least 4 hours. Usually I survive an hour and the app charges just the amount of time as long as you remember to stop it when you get in the car. There has also been a situation before the corona in the parking lot next to the Opera, where in the rain I have charged the parking time in peace in the car when there is a long queue in the rain in front of the field parking meter. Sometimes there is a bit of searching for the area number and it has to check the area parking meter sticker.;5;2020-11-15;15.13.1

171;Maria Järvinen;Works really well :);5;2020-11-15;15.13.1
172;Arto Kannisto;Simple and easy. The only thing that is bad is not always giving the correct area number if there are two areas next to each other, then you need to check that you have registered yourself in the right area. Once I experienced a situation where the parking attendant already wrote a fine even though an easy parking fee was installed and when I submitted the matter then the supervisor said I was in the right area but eadypark had registered parking in the adjacent area where my car was at the border.;5;2020-11-15;15.13.1

180;Jussi Nurmela;The fool of walking back and forth and queuing at the payment machine is left out when you turn this on. There is also no need to rush to add coins to the vending machine if the visit is delayed and not reserve parking money for the car. The only problem is when you get into kstsomasn when many others still do this old-fashioned hustle .... It would make sense to go for advice but ... people don't like to be better qualified!;5;2020-11-14;15.13.1

208;kebable;Easy to use parking app! Personally, I really like the fact that this works seamlessly abroad as well (my own experience from Sweden), no need to start adjusting with local parking apps! The small downside comes from the fact that card charges take place (in my experience) ~ with a one-week delay, which makes it a bit more difficult and delaying to make a travel invoice when I have to wait for a receipt for parking.;5;2020-11-13;15.13.1

230;Maarit Laakso;Easy to use, but why not show the price of parking every time you stop parking? Prices can of course be found when going separately to look at your own car parks.

235;Marko Reunanen;A good and easy app, as an additional feature it would be useful to get started parking at times other than immediately. For example, you could already set the next day's parking to start according to the parking time in the evening, at the moment the application will stop parking max. according to the parking time (usually 4h) even if you rotate the parking for the next day 4h ahead of the start of parking.;4;2020-11-13;15.13.1

242;Jorma Juvonen;Quite happy about it in general.however, for some reason the EP has not on a few occasions identified the parking lot of Peijas Hospital with the location information of the phone, but I had to retrieve it from the sticker of the parking machine.

244;Saija Haapa-Paananen;Easy to use and convenient application! However, the notice / warning of the end of the parking time often goes unnoticed. Fortunately, there have been no fines nonetheless :) If you could hope for something, then when the parking time expires you could see a suggestion do you want to continue parking in the same place? Then you could increase the time even if you were somewhere other than the car.;5;2020-11-13;15.13.1

332;Pentti Niska;I function well. Sometimes there was a problem in the center of Helsinki that it was not possible to charge more than an hour of parking time even though there were no obstacles. I reported to EasyPark and hopefully the bug has been fixed. An E parking app is available for a Volvo car (one model) as it is available for other Volvo models ??;4;2020-11-12;15.13.1
333;Sakari Perkola;No complaints. Many parking meters are difficult to use and especially those that require a registration number. Especially in the cold, the surface burns. Different cities have their own metrics and payment methods that are difficult to understand. I know how to use EasyPark and I use it for a reason that I don’t like parking error fees. 😊;4;2020-11-12;15.13.1
334;Googlen käyttäjä;Easy to use. Sometimes it would be easier if the application automatically recognized the area code. A parking meter with an area code printed on it is sometimes laborious to find.;5;2020-11-12;15.13.1

348;Kirsi Vaali;Well here I’ve always had trouble in Hgin Market Square Park (where I park once a week), the app just doesn’t know how to locate there. There’s always a rush, and the thing just takes and takes when I try to get it to accept the area. I would much rather use that easier calling service (automatic) at this point, but damn it, that area code isn't in that push at the edge of the market, even though everything else can be found !! I by no means remember any of those numbers, and I really grab it a lot. Now there was a new problem: when I have both a private card and a company on the same phone, I don't even know which one it now charges ...;2;2020-11-12;15.10

And the fines came .. even for exemplary action. In the parking lot and I paid the parking fee. I got said. I complained about it. The fine company does not comment on the easypark program.

If there was any other service, I would use it.

666;Karlo Villa;The app works mostly well, but a credit card valid until 5/19 is no longer valid as a payment method. However, the card is valid by the end of the month and for a while you have to pay for parking at something other than EasyPark.;2;2019-05-02;13.1

691;Googlen käyttäjä;In general, the application works quite well. Yesterday I received a parking fine because the parking entries did not register for the city of Tampere. However, the matter was handled with EasyPark customer service;4;2019-02-21;12.5
692;Googlen käyttäjä;Sometimes the app does not find the location of your car even when you are in the parking lot, when you put yourself an arrow there is a risk that you will find the wrong parking space and result in fines. Be careful.;1;2019-02-21;12.3
693;Jari Malm;"Install the app and get a discount" ... I ended up paying for parking even more than a normal payment method would require. The correction cannot be made. The explanation, as always, is the customer's own fault. It is a mistake in your practice if a normal awake user is able to adopt procedures.;1;2019-02-21;12.5
694;Googlen käyttäjä;For one reason or another, after the update the application works properly. Previously, it got stuck locating or entering the area code. Good.;4;2019-02-19;12.5
695;J. Koponen;It’s handy in use, but I wonder the amount of payments. For example, a full-time park in Auriga, Turku, costs € 7 with a card, but € 10.20 via you. Pretty big difference ...;3;2019-02-11;12.3
696;Googlen käyttäjä;Works.;4;2019-02-11;12.3

699;Googlen käyttäjä;otherwise ok but will terminate the credit card prematurely. my card is still valid until the end of this month, and no new one has yet come. however, the app requires a new card information. on the other hand, also accepts the validity of the current card so that I can park.

709;Sauli Marila;Otherwise it works, but the map quite often disappears from the screen. When you press the location button, the map flashes quickly and disappears again immediately. Because of this, it’s hard to judge whether I’m in the right area or not.;4;2019-01-08;12.0
710;Ytuser Sumone;It starts all by itself in the background and consumes a considerable amount of power. Was this the one that also launched the gps function on its own? This, like all applications, should be completely off before launching.;2;2019-01-05;11.7

718;Andre Kullström;Works!;4;2018-12-13;11.8
719;Kari Pulkkinen;For some reason, the app starts itself in the background and therefore wastes battery power. It's not about that push notification. Android 8 (Samsung 8) indicates that the app is on and consuming power. Same bug in the family on another Android phone.;2;2018-12-12;12.0

737;Marko Mäkinen;Otherwise, very happy with the app, but the background of the app could do nothing when the app has not been used.

744;Tuomo Ketola;One of the most important applications for the automotive person, which still works pretty well. Sometimes you have to enter the area code manually when, for one reason or another, the phone does not locate the area.;4;2018-10-05;11.5.1

749;KariK;Really confusing pricing. You should check their invoices for what they charge, website pricing has not been up to date. Hopefully there will be better options on offer.;1;2018-09-21;11.4

758;Googlen käyttäjä;We go downhill. Before this, one could conclude that the car is in the Park at the point where the ball appears on the map. Today, it offers an area from some side.

762;Mindy Virtanen;The app is really good and easy to use, but damn expensive. Day standing in the port and 21e payment, if the coins would not have paid but 12e. Why the site gives the impression that it is cheap but actually quite something change ??;1;2018-06-27;10.9
763;Leila Joensuu;Good software, but ... At least finding the area code in Hgi is almost limp invariably. And yes, wifi is in the background. Samsung as a phone Galaxy note8. Annoying to fetch that machine, that's why I downloaded this, that I get rid of the vending machine search. That when you put it to work properly, so the score also improves. Answer by the developer: gps and wifi are on throughout time, not just for this application.;3;2018-06-18;10.8
764;THEweelaful;Quite OK. Reliable and easy. You should be careful when you spend more time bounce in between for some reason behind the confirmation after a while though new time confirmed ..;3;2018-06-16;10.4.3

771;Googlen käyttäjä;Saves the day every time you have to take your car to a parking lot where you would have to enter money. You never have cash or coins involved, so this app is soooo convenient! I recommend. :);5;2018-05-31;10.5.1
772;Googlen käyttäjä;Works great in all respects, I use it almost every working day.;5;2018-05-31;10.8
773;Googlen käyttäjä;Good service, saves on running the meter. Personally, I have experienced the problem mainly that EasyPark is not always sure whether it is in the car park or in the right car park, and asks for confirmation. Confirmation will be given, even if you do not know whether there is a real parking lot here now. In such a case, it would be good if there was a link on the screen to a map of the area in question, in which the identification numbers of the nearby parking areas would be marked.;4;2018-05-30;10.8
774;Pirjo Koskinen;Makes life really much easier. Save money. No need for coins or any cards. Clear billing. I will never change this app again if it is possible.;5;2018-05-30;10.8
775;AM H;Always works! An added plus is that in a stranger city as well find your car back with EasyPark parking. That's what happened In Denmark.;5;2018-05-30;10.8
776;Kari Kristo;Really good and easy to use no need to run in the city all the time increasing the time the meter takes just rotates the dial and accepts grace;4;2018-05-30;10.8
777;Timo Laes;Absolutely great with all the adjustments. Saves unnecessary steps and taking care. Of course, you have to be precise to remember to stop parking especially if you have set the rear limit considerably far actual parking time.;5;2018-05-30;10.8

780;Sanna Elers;Great service .. often, however, automatic area detection doesn't play and usually just when you've left your car "far" from the payment device where you can peek at the area code. Otherwise very good service, and 10 min to the vampire before the end of the parking period is thank you for staying!;4;2018-05-30;10.8
781;Mia;Worked almost flawlessly and really makes life in the city easier! Wonderful no need to run to the car to increase time but succeed on the phone. Some upgrades are not quite successful and another registry number there were some difficulties in adding.;4;2018-05-30;10.8
782;Tony Kilponen;Makes life easier and lowers costs.;5;2018-05-30;10.6.1
783;Risto Tanner;Redeem promises - the most useful is the extension of the parking time on the phone when schedules fail, as well as not having to pay too much when the selected time can be cut off if desired. Automatic detection of the parking area could work better, but it is usually easily found on the side of the parking meter.;4;2018-05-30;10.8

793;Emil Pohjalainen;There was no consensus on buying a ticket when the graphics were that way ass, I then bought a pretty standard textured ticket. Then I did from easypark in a couple of hours to get the FIRST confirmation message that read that the parking time I bought will end a quarter of an hour!

Good that the money was valid @ & € # @ ..;1;2018-05-21;10.7.2

I paid an hour too much for the broken latest version of this App parking. Now suddenly an emergency fix for this. The app is full at the moment unusable.;1;2018-05-14;10.7.2
805;Ville Kallio;The latest update completely breaks the graphics. I just got in trouble somewhere in a paid parking space and I don't even know where or how much it costs. The start of the kioco is shown quite a bit from the clock, only a slice is visible that hour can be guessed. Now you need a quick repair phone Huawei p 10;1;2018-05-14;10.7.2

944;Googlen käyttäjä;Rarely can you locate yourself in the right place and find the right code, so you have to press the locate button. With more than one vehicle, you must be careful that the correct vehicle is selected. When the application is running in the background, positioning stays on to consume battery power.

960;Timo Kortelainen;I have not ensured the accuracy of the invoice (eg whether the earlier termination of parking will arrive), but the usability is relatively good and easy.

It was not mentioned and will go unnoticed if you do not search for the information yourself. So that worryingly few debates had noticed that. It is not specified in the "receipts" of the parking history. I even read a blog written by an author who had tried Easypark and maybe rejoiced that he had saved a couple of euros when he didn’t have to put in extra time to be sure. That parking fee was 1.49e. 0.59e almost 50%!;1;2016-10-09;5.7.1

1063;Simeon Suoninen;The card could not be added when the program claims that the number does not match the card type. I tried to search the website for information about the questions, but the answers to the frequently asked questions do not open. I tried to change the settings on the website then, but that doesn't work either, because either the page doesn't respond to clicks or it doesn't save data. Also, I guess I lost my welcome letter and sticker (which I obviously would have received for free?) When I wanted to change its shipping address. However, the sticker costs only € 2, which of course also saves money when the program does nothing. I really don’t recommend the program. Rarely has the user experience been so annoying. It just doesn’t simply work.;1;2016-08-30;5.6

1075;Miska K;I guess staying on the coins, + 15% / parking is the same as putting those coins but there on the machine. So definitely good for those who exercise daily. For occasional use not so much. I would add here that the 21% you "save" is actually 6%. In other words, that +15% means that each parking costs 15% more than coins, so in the end it is 15%, for example € 2 for parking it makes € 0.30 more. That is 2.30 €.

1115;Matias Kristian Kantola;Tried to enter OP Visa Electron card information for a longer time, but the application corresponds to "Creditcard not supported" and the card is not supported. Apparently, however, should a Visa Electron with a credit feature be supported by different sources? The application will not be able to be used until the card information has been received. You could even choose another payment method but not. EDIT: Contacted customer service and now the app works!;4;2016-02-15;5.3

1120;Getter Ojaots;In fact, when I don’t own anything other than visa elecrtron it’s a little impractical to use that Apps when no my card is accepted as a means of payment. Otherwise, really good.

1122;Lari Lohikoski;Very convenient for parking, but ate my phone battery cheekily before I turned off the motion tracking setting. It only took several months before I found naming this app to be to blame for battery wear. Such a nasty surprise should not be standard on the app.;3;2016-01-19;5.2

1220;Kristian Viding;Based on the experience of the first day, I wonder how I have managed so long without this! However, one development suggestion would be: it would be good to be able to set the parking time so that it continues automatically after the selected end time (a reminder, of course, as usual). This feature would be useful, for example, in a situation where the meeting stretches and for one reason or another is unable to use the mobile phone (e.g. no network).;4;2013-12-03;3.4
1221;Harri Saralampi;The latest update is a sack in the yard and is no longer allowed to log in. Reinstallation does not help / password ordering does not help. Addition to the previous one: - easypark took care of the problem right away! Thanks for that!;5;2013-11-17;3.4

1223;Jari K;Works flawlessly on Galaxy S4 as well as Tab2. Good and fast to use;4;2013-11-04;3.3.1
1224;Kari Törmä;The program asks for the area code but does not show area boundaries on the map. In any case, you have to look for a vending machine where you can get the area code and at that point you could already pay with a card on the device without a 15% surcharge.;2;2013-09-03;3.3
1225;Sami Lahtimaa;First use in Turku at first worked well but then the software did nothing. Oops and no contact and other error messages. The phone is S4.;2;2013-07-31;3.2

1229;Arto Liukko;The program works great and in several cities.;5;2013-04-19;3.0.9
1230;Googlen käyttäjä;With the latest update, this only got bad. Starts up quite infinitely slow, leaving the gps in the background to spin even when parking is started.

Incomprehensible updating.;1;2013-04-16;3.0.10

1235;Kalle Rautiainen;The development seems to be happening even when there should be even a small button in this new version to manually enter the end time as well as the feature to get the program activated on the phone after an alarm expiration is sent so no more could be hoped for :-);4;2012-12-14;2.2

1247;äölkkjhgfds;Suitable for good and clear use. It is also gratifying that you can link mobilepay to the payment. Of course, there is room for improvement in the application, ie the register number could be in a larger font. Sometimes mistakenly specified time for another car, with which movement and as a result 3 € parking fee + 50 € erroneous parking fee ... that's what it seems to do🥸!

1256;kerrassaanpettynyt;It takes about three times to go to mobilepay to pay before it appears that parking has started because the app somehow lags every time I try to use it.

4th April. It’s Easter holiday and the app showed it was free parking in an area where I drove to. And when I came out I received a parking ticket which said “parking fee not paid” 22th April. I parked my car on the side of a road and PAID the parking fee as the app indicated. Later I got a ticket said “parking without a disc”. I called in and the line person said that street is only allowed parking with a disc.  But the app didn’t not say so and charged my money.    Can’t stand the faults information that the app gives. And also parking with this app is more expensive than paying for parking normally.   BE CAREFUL WITH THIS APP.;1;2021-04-22;15.20.0

Even if the car is in the right area on the map, the app can still give the parking lot number after 300 meters ... and as stated, the supplier does not take any responsibility.

1317;As1akas;Parking works just fine. However, I would like you to rethink that receipt issue. It is not modern to make it difficult to get a receipt. I understand your little extra income which justifies a bit so js like this?  I would need a receipt sometimes during business hours. I had your company service, the inconvenience was having to invoice the employer once a month. If it were possible to pay the full year's fee at once, it would employ less.

1323;Tuomas Nguyen;I have been a user of Easy Park since 2013, in those early days, the UX/UI and reliability were very amateurish. Slowly the app gets better but there are still bunch of reliability and performance issues, and can't be on par with industry standard. Incorrect or inability to lockdown your location, battery drain, slow response time. Last but not least, somehow EasyPark doesn't want people to order their sticker anymore, but they still leave the Oder stick button which doesn't do anything when tap on.;2;2019-06-11;13.3

In addition, the whole application is unusable silos, you can not use any of the other features of the application.

1367;mckake01;Location is missing! You have to find the area codes yourself. Awaiting update!;1;2011-09-22;1.1
1368;leon_wang;Big timer icon blocks cost texts and feeling difficult to use with new fancy interface;3;2017-12-12;10.1
1369;Nökäre;Yes it was hard to use. The app claimed that the Q-Park car park is not an Easypark area. Had to walk to the vending machine and enter the Easypark area code which can only be found on the side of the vending machine. After that I still had to put the car registration number separately even though I had already put all the information about the car in this app. All the while excited that there will be a payment slip, uncertain thing. The company’s website had different information about billing than what was then in the app itself and in reality. Logging in to the app was also awkward and confusing.;1;2017-08-12;5.9
1370;d1geo;Incredibly bad!;1;2016-07-12;5.5
1371;Ekkualizer;The app doesn’t offer much added value to a phone-based payment until you get an area based on location and the app allows you to browse your own history. Remembering the location of the car would also be a useful feature.;2;2011-11-07;1.1
1372;mr.espoo;The latest version did not improve on previous shortcomings:  Really good help with paying parking fees. Works at least in Helsinki and Tampere. Suggestion for improvement: display of parking history and the ability to easily add time to the last parking space where parking time has run out.  Sending receipts for a fee is a really embarrassing feature. Why on earth should they still be paid for?;3;2017-11-22;10.0.3
1373;Der Nordlinger;I pay to use the app, is I still forced to push in extra push notifications about features?  It wouldn't bother to disable notifications completely, because notification before parking runs out is convenient.;1;2017-11-30;10.0.3
1374;paikanvaihtaja;New version usability deteriorated Digital selection removed, selection dial is annoying to use The end time is big but the remaining time is unnecessarily small, I would be much more interested in the remaining time.;1;2017-11-30;10.0.3
1375;Instafani;Really confusing and obscure interface after the upgrade. Why was something that was not broken repaired? Otherwise, of course, great service.;2;2017-11-27;10.0.3
1376;AnuMus;With the update, entering the parking lot number is pretty hopeless. Often the search box is not activated and street parking is not found or suggested automatically. This causes it to open and close the application again, hoping that at some point the search box will occasionally start working, because most of the time, the first time you tap it, nothing happens. Otherwise, the upgrade updates are good.;3;2017-11-13;10.0.1
1377;Sakkernakkeri;Hasn't worked badly since the last update. I set the parking time and press start parking so the program crashes. Really a pity when I used to work flawlessly. I'm trying the parkman app.;1;2017-11-22;10.0.3
1378;Skumppa666;In the past, my app worked well and I used this every time I parked. Now that positioning no longer works and the interface feels confusing anyway, I switched to a competitor. That's where positioning works.;1;2017-11-21;10.0.3
1379;Taviomaa;Why the hell has iPhone 4S support been discontinued? The application is not so complicated that older users should drop it off. Even though you all have handsets less than a year old in the office, not everyone does.;1;2017-11-21;10.0.3
1380;missbigi;New update useless. Went too complicated. For example, you can no longer see an estimate of the price of a stop. I guess to go to the exchange.;1;2017-11-10;10.0.1
1381;gunnar gren;Why are you sending an update to your iphone 5 when it can't be updated. I have ios 10.3.3 I have tried many times and failed. I have untried times and will always just re-update it;1;2017-11-09;10.0.1

1390;KaarleV;I’ve already saved hundreds at Easy Park and don’t have to fumble with coins or go by car to increase parking time. The app is clear and easy, as is the online service. All places covered by Easy Park, please!;5;2017-10-10;5.9.1
1391;TirNanOge;Easy to use, and when the program finds the right parking space on the map at the touch of a button, it's quite quick and convenient. I like when you can extend the parking time at a restaurant table or fitting room 😁👍🏻;5;2017-10-08;5.9.1
1392;PPÖ;Friction-free use;5;2017-10-06;5.9.1
1393;Mika TL;A nice easy way to pay for parking only as much as you really need. Payment times are not correct in some areas, but it mainly works as it should. Even the monthly payments for the service do not end in dizziness.  A nice addition would be if you get some notification after the parking supervisor has checked the parking spaces found with the registration number from easy Park. It would warm the mind to know that “premium parking” has been avoided.;3;2017-10-05;5.9.1
1394;Perdoon;The app has worked really well and flawlessly in the past, it has been a big help in parking. Now, for one reason or another, you will no longer receive receipts from the app or they will be emailed after your order with a delay of several days. This makes it difficult to stay up-to-date on the receipt of receipts and there is a risk that some receipt will be forgotten. Hopefully this will be fixed as soon as possible because otherwise the app will be useful.  The location does not want to work properly and even if you stand next to the parking meter, the location may suggest another location or area. Here are the shortcomings.;3;2017-04-05;5.8.5
1395;HKnen;I took care of the parking through the app and also got confirmation of starting the parking. However, the app did not quite work as desired and in the morning the car was waiting for a fine. Nothing is displayed in the parking history, but the account information was saved by the application .. Pretty suspicious.;1;2017-10-01;5.9.1
1396;Harjus3;Launches so slowly that it thinks the apps have frozen. A one-time charge of € 0.59 for each parking lot is outrageously expensive. € 0.19 would sound like an appropriate fee.;2;2017-09-29;5.9.1
1397;Lasse-on-iOS;Immediately after the first use, the user experience seems poor. Here, for example, we have a company billing a user for a receipt they send them via email. Ridiculous! Generally, companies are able to send a receipt automatically and free of charge. (Fortunately, you can work around the problem with a screenshot.)  Let's see what other mocha is still revealed.;1;2017-08-12;5.9

1401;B-luokan makkara;Logging in on multiple devices is not working properly. The whole idea of ​​the app is to be easy to use, but this is just totally shit. Stealing coins from a beggar is easier and more fun.;1;2016-12-21;5.8.3

1413;sz.janne;After adjusting the time, the time is reset in a real emergency. The fingers of an unfamiliar user do not have time to get involved.  Clear prices, billing method, etc. are really hard to find. Is there a start-up fee, monthly fee, etc. for the private user?  The exact amounts are displayed.  Good for a used user, not for beginners.  I stay in the parking lot.;3;2016-07-12;5.5

1417;Kurapaskaaaa;The application does not work;1;2016-06-22;5.5
1418;Kisdfg;Completely substandard implementation for a good idea. Payment by credit card, ie must provide card information. Not by any means like this, but with mobile payment by phone bill and without registration obligation. And on top of all that, those stickers that need to be glued to the car. What if I park while renting a car? Will there be fines when the sticker is missing?  All private as well as public car parks should be included.  Due to credit card payment this should not be used. Never enter credit card numbers for these services.;1;2016-06-01;5.5
1419;Petem5;Before five stars, now only two. I forgot to upgrade to a new card and a few euros was charged on the invoice. Spiced with a billing surcharge, of course. My moka but I guess I still try another because this doesn't seem to develop into anything. I would have updated that card for sure the next time I use it though. 6s + support is still missing. A good app, by the way, even after its time. Two stars mainly because of the bad mood.  I went to Parkman. For Parkman you get € 10 free parking with promo code 2HJC.;2;2016-05-28;5.5
1420;Nalsukram;A really good solution for a lot of people traveling by car (in different countries and cities). The speed is starting to be ok, as well as the zone selection has been made easier. I use constantly, works.;4;2016-05-23;5.5

1435;johanneseret;otherwise a good app but i wish in the future i could set the time when the park starts. For example, if you have to pay at 9 am and go to a meeting at 8:30, I have to put a reminder at 8:59 on the phone and adjust with it in the middle of the day.;4;2015-10-14;5.0

1445;Artahil;A good and useful program. Works well if the connections work properly. For example, time can be increased when schedules are stretched / changed without visiting the parking meter. I have noticed that when a wifi connection is made, the functionality may be disrupted. However, this is handled when you disconnect the wifi connection for a moment and use the telephone network.;5;2015-05-26;4.5
1446;Paras peli;Good program. Not much could be better;5;2015-05-16;4.5
1447;Taantumus;Silly puck! Shouldn't the interface be gradually updated for 2015? Okay + 15% off the price, but at least 60 cents. The savings easily dwindle to that minimum fee for short parking. On the other hand, this is a handy help for someone sitting in a meeting in the city center on an hour-long basis to increase parking time.;2;2015-04-02;4.4
1448;PetriC72;It goes quickly, smoothly and works perfectly. You do not have to bring anything other than a smartphone when you park and you get a reminder when time is running out. It is then easy to extend if you need to without getting to the car park. The top!;5;2015-03-14;4.3

1459;SPQR today;Decent app for outstanding idea of paying for parking with your phone. Not for short parkings though due to expensive starting charges. Could notify about end of parking through push messages as well as SMS.  The UX of the app could see lots of improvement. The app loads slowly on 4S and selecting the area and car (if you have more than one) is also slow and takes several ignored taps at worst. Usually you are in a bit of a hurry while parking which makes UI delays even more annoying.;4;2014-05-27;3.6.3
1460;Qwertylady;Works slowly, sometimes crashes, positioning doesn't work;2;2014-08-15;3.8
1461;Jammi+;At least on the iPhone 4, it works really hard. It may take a minute to open the program and usage is also slow. The areas cannot be found in the center of Helsinki with location, but you have to look for the nearest parking terminal to enter the area.;2;2014-08-05;3.8
1462;Ile1977;You no longer need coins when cash is otherwise going digital. You can also make the time shorter or longer if necessary - really easy. I can't take receipts out of working hours, for example, so that I can get my costs back from my employer.;4;2013-10-26;3.3

1474;Autski;This app is great! There is certainly room for improvement here, but this is also going well.  However, I give 3.5 stars because when the need is rare, every couple of months, the base fee is not paused. I suggest a feature for the app that stops the "base charge" for example when the app is not used for two weeks.  Another great feature is location. When you drive into EasyPark's parking area, the app reports a parking ID based on location (area 301, will parking be started?).  These when you still get the app, you would definitely have a full five stars!;4;2013-06-26;3.1

1586;Jan Erlend Garshol;There is still a lot that should be improved on this app. But it is probably the best parking app anyway. And just get used to this way of parking. For example, if you use automatic sign reading, you must make sure that parking is stopped when exiting. There have been a lot of calls to the parking companies to stop and start parking. Especially on the car with green signs. They sort it out quickly.;3;2021-08-03;15.24.1

1607;Torkel Christiansen;EasyPark has worked flawlessly since the first time I started using this app a few years back. A good point - which I constantly inform others, who will be installing the parking app for the first time - is that this app works in all parking lots. In addition, EasyPark is so unorthodox when it comes to customer service that you get alerts well in advance of the parking. The app is, of all the apps on my mobile, the one that never crashes.;5;2021-07-20;15.23.0

When contacting Onepark, I am informed that a 15% fee is charged at Easypark when using the app. So then it is pointless to use the app where there is sign recognition.

1667;En Google-bruker;Do not trust the name of the app - it looks simple, but there is a lot to take care of. Check and see if you two or three times if the app indicates the correct parking space, it is you who has to pay dearly if the app misses the location, which happens quite often. Then you have to pay both parking fee and penalty fee. The parking agency is the most ruthless of the courts and does not allow any digital errors, at least not for the customer.;1;2021-05-25;15.21.0
1668;Odd-Arne Andahl;Absolutely great to use EasyPark. Just be sure to update the phone, now it says no. Have never had problems with this app. Heard that many have it, it may be that they in the bluff to update.;5;2021-05-25;15.21.0

1706;André Mangseth;Steer away! I have experienced a fine despite using the app. It found the parking space, the code and the fare, but I was fined because I was still registered in a completely different zone, 8 km away. I contacted customer service and they thought I had pushed myself to the place myself (something I did not do) and that the code and rate was completely different than what the app stated. There are competitors who are both better, cheaper and who have better customer service.;1;2021-03-03;15.17.1
1707;Geir Grasli;Simple and straightforward app. Nice overview of parking spaces, as well as own notes.

Possibility of historical overview of the parking lots. It is nice to be able to check the parking against the invoice from the card company. Good to be able to post favorite places. Now in these corona times, it's okay to not have to use the vending machines. Nice to be able to get notice just before time runs out. Disadvantages: Could have been a little cheaper to use. A bit bad on gps especially when it is crowded with parking spaces and you have not added favorite spaces.

1785;Ako Mohammadi;Like the app, but is one thing I miss and that is that parking stops automatically when you leave the parking lot.

1788;Per Øivind Hansen;Works absolutely great for me 👍 I have been using this app for a couple of years now and do not have a negative thing to say. In fact, you only pay for the time you spend. On very short stops I have not been charged and I am notified a few minutes before that my time is running out. Easy to change number when changing cars is also positive.

1790;Endre Vingen Eide;You can not trust this system. I ended up paying for easypark at the same time as I was fined at the other end as competing parking facilities are so close together that gps hits errors inside the facilities. The flexibility of the app is not only gone, the security and trust as well. There is no point in complaining about this. I think the future would rather go to the vending machine itself to pay directly to the facility.

1794;Charlotte Boger;There is something in the layout here that is far too easy to misunderstand for a beginner. I had set with tilt, time and place and started the clock wheel and thought everything was fine when I got out of the car, but no. Penalty and remark about the wrong tariff zone and this was what I had not got with me. Maybe I had not read enough about this, but I feel cheated. You MUST inform this section more clearly !!!;1;2020-09-16;15.11.1
1795;Leif Inge Thorsen;It is absolutely excellent, but I have experienced that the parking time has turned off before the time has expired. Do not know if it's me who caused it, the phone or an error with the app.;5;2020-09-13;15.11.1

1804;Ole-Fredrik Kvalnes;Very satisfied. Easy when they have an agreement with many of the parking companies.

1812;Oddmund Brevik;Steer away! When extending the parking time, this apparently goes through, but it is still not registered. This was an experience that cost NOK 600 in fines. Do not use this app if you want to avoid fines! EasyPark owes me NOK 600. Update 04.08.2020: After several emails with customer service, they will not help. The fine imposed is due to technical failure and / or errors with the service. With lousy service, the app will not be used anymore as a result of this handling.;1;2020-08-04;15.8
1813;Shuaib Mian;Be careful if you park at code 3054, there will be no price. I thought it was free to pay 86 kroner. It was not the landing that cost money, but the parking. Lureri.;1;2020-08-04;15.9
1814;Simon Rørholt;Ok;4;2020-08-03;15.3
1815;Ingvar Henne;Be careful - you pay an extra surcharge of 15% and can only save money if you finish parking earlier than expected. Do not use the app unless it is very uncertain how long you will park.;2;2020-07-28;15.9

1832;Thomas Aspeseter;Very bad you can not remove card info without adding new payment solutions.

Is also more expensive one and pay at vending machines;1;2020-06-25;15.8

1834;Trond Almbakk;If you want more expensive parking, pay for free parking and not be heard at the customer center. Then this is the right app for you. With this app, you pay double the price of what is on the payment machine and can pay for periods where you can simply park the car for free. If you want the app, do not download it. If you have the app, delete it;1;2020-06-24;15.8

1840;Christian Våge;New assessment (June 2020): Easypark has thus managed to enter the entire company fleet of cars in my PRIVATE ACCOUNT, so that I have been deducted for this. They even think I have parked all the cars. Since someone else can start a parking on my account, and it said that I had a camera-started parking (which I thought was me of course) I was fined 700 kroner. Absolutely reprehensible.;1;2020-06-17;12.7

I used the app and entered the correct information. Nevertheless, there was a parking fine of 600 kroner, which feels very unfair.;1;2020-01-22;14.9
1954;Stian Martinsen;Great. Did not log in, but discovered that it was because my phone number was entered with +47 in front, and the app added it again. As soon as I removed it, it worked again.;5;2020-01-22;14.9

1980;Henning Larssen;Following a recommendation from a colleague, I tried EasyPark for the first time in 2007, and have been a regular subscriber ever since! EasyPark has made parking completely and totally stress-free. Just a few simple keystrokes with tariff group for the place, reg no to the car, desired parking time. If you are delayed, just extend the parking inside the EasyParki app. EasyPark can also be used outside Norway👍👍👍 ABSOLUTELY TOP !!!!;5;2019-12-24;14.6.1

2015;Dan Emil Aamot;Another app that will make life easier, but rather the opposite. Costs 15% extra, or a minimum of DKK 4. To park with the app. Receipt is sent by email the next day (NOK 3 extra), which means that you can not write a travel invoice the same day. The customer also does not receive an invoice the same day, due to parking receipt coming the day after, that one has been with the customer. And when I linked the app to the app, it was to be approved with NOK 1, which was not to be charged. But .... Account was charged 2x 1kr.;1;2019-10-22;14.3

Just stood loading when I was about to open the app. Got started it later when I was connected to wifi, but by then I had already paid with a card for parking.

2025;OES 25;Lureri. Here they have taken NOK 39 a month for over half a year, without me having deliberately ordered any subscription at all.

Should have allowed us to start parking with vehicle No. 2 at the same time, without ending existing parking first, otherwise good.;5;2018-12-03;11.8
2281;Tove Walczyk;gull;5;2018-12-03;11.8
2282;Ingunn Eidsaa;Very good - makes parking easy. And you do not have to be afraid of parking fines, as the app warns when the parking starts to run out. Used the app for over a year now.;5;2018-11-30;11.8
2283;Tom Finbraaten;Innmari easy.;5;2018-11-29;11.8
2284;Øyvind Røkenes;Easy to use and easy to understand. Makes parking a lot easier.;5;2018-11-29;11.8
2285;TMO;EasyPark is an absolutely fantastic app, but the last month then I have not had the opportunity to move on after I have spun the wheel. The app wants me to add a payment method even though I have done it several times.;4;2018-11-29;11.8
2286;Mariann Oden;Am very happy with the app in the beginning, but lately it has started to log me out automatically between each time I use it. It's a bit frustrating 😳 But apart from the little thing, I think the app is very good 😊;4;2018-11-28;11.8
2287;Øystein Heggelund;Easily,;5;2018-11-28;11.8
2288;Ludde og Mats;This is a 'must have' app;5;2018-11-23;11.8
2289;Roar Berntsen;The app does not work. End time is wrong.;1;2018-11-23;11.4
2290;Arild Medhus;Very good, but would like to have a better warning system for if you forget to stop the parking;4;2018-11-22;11.8

2292;Roger Bråthen;Have Android and can't see how long I have valid parking when I spin the wheel. Have deleted and installed without it getting better.;1;2018-11-09;11.7
2293;Jan Christer Uthus;Why does it say in English when I finish parking? And why do you get a lot of messages after parking is over? Do not need notification after I have finished inside the app. Update !!;2;2018-11-06;11.7
2294;Svein Anton Johansen;Very good;4;2018-11-05;11.7
2295;Kristian Winsjansen;Best parking app I've come across. Very easy to use 👏;5;2018-11-03;11.6.1
2296;Jan Ove Hasseløsæter;I feel EasyPark owes me 600, - enough. I selected car, selected zone, set the desired time and pressed 'Start parking'. Closed the phone book and went to my dentist class. When I came out I had been fined. Checked the app and obviously the 'Start parking' button does not mean that you start parking. To put it mildly, pissed off. I found out that obviously you have to choose a car again AFTER pressing 'start parking' EVEN IF you have already chosen a car. REMOVE THIS DISADVANTAGE! I expect the parking to start when you have chosen the car in advance and press the button that will start the parking! This worked before! DRAWER! Feeling cheated!;1;2018-11-02;10.8
2297;Jan Olav Rasmussen;Works well;5;2018-11-02;11.6.1
2298;Richard Kielland;Could have been better functionality if you are to find a parking space on the map, without having position service turned on;4;2018-11-02;11.6.1
2299;Kojin Aso Said;Very good app, but the problem is that I do not even get into it;1;2018-11-02;11.6.1
2300;Atle Magnussen;Seriously, when a phone is set to English then nothing works properly. A little elaborate: should find 10151 (electric car charging) was suggested Canada somwhere. Change the language of the phone to Norwegian and it worked out. Why use language like that? you have clear access to the phone's location.;1;2018-11-02;11.6.1
2301;Kristoffer Skogseid;Sends self-promotion on push without the possibility to turn this off.;2;2018-10-27;11.6.1
2302;Helge Osland;Pure scam. I was fined because the app showed the wrong location and in the event of a complaint, the company places all responsibility on me and does not take any responsibility for the app being inaccurate.;1;2018-10-26;11.4

2317;Christine Jordet;Stopped and changed place name or parking night you see it yourself. Received two fines recently due to errors with the app;1;2018-09-25;11.3.1
2318;Mary Johannessen;Incredibly unprofessional, you get fines even when you pay and when you call to talk to them, you start a conversation and when the questions become too difficult for them they just stop answering and wait for you to hang up! I know I'm really pissed that it's so unprofessional !!;1;2018-09-12;11.3.1
2319;Bror;Avoid. Wasted time. Find another parking space.;1;2018-09-09;11.3.1
2320;Petter Unneberg;This has become one of the worst apps. Uses data in the background, even though I have disabled everything. In two days without me using it, the app has used almost 1 kb in the background.;1;2018-09-07;11.3.1
2321;larenzo Skjelfjord;Miserable app. Position does not work and you easily end up paying parking in the wrong place. Outcome .... bot !!;1;2018-08-31;11.3.1

2323;Jan Erik Kasin;Unfortunately, the app has gotten worse. Entered the number that is on the payment machine but then only parking in the US will appear? The app also continues to run in the background so you have to force it to quit. Maybe you should do a cleanup.;2;2018-08-28;11.3.1

2336;Nina O;DO NOT use this app. It is incredibly bad at finding the right parking on gps. I have now received 2 fines for paying a parking ticket for one other parking than I ACTUALLY stood on. Never use that stairwell to park again. Then I should rather look like a hawk for a vending machine !!;1;2018-08-05;11.1.2

2342;n0skillz Wanderer;Yes, you save a few seconds by not having to take it to the vending machine, and it is easier to remember to stop parking. But, when one repeatedly experiences that the app deducts the amount from the account and in addition reserves the same amount, so you get very tired eventually. Okay the reserved amount is coming back, but not until 2-3 days have passed. Then you sit there with 150kr less than one thought abruptly. No, the app is now deleted after a few months of use.;2;2018-07-24;11.1.1
2343;Erik;I always get a lot of popups about easypark running in the background even if I do not have been using it for several months. The app is now uninstalled;1;2018-07-24;5.9

2351;H. N.;Absolutely miserable that it is not possible to enter the tariff group manually, but that we have to deal with outdated maps and look for which parking space we is on. Fix this, you guys are fine. Until then, the whole app is just irritating.;1;2018-07-04;10.9
2352;Charlotte;Simple and good app and easy to plan where to park in advance! The only suggestion I have is to enter which places have their own motorcycle parking! I often have to look to see if this is the case one place, would have been convenient to have in the app :);5;2018-06-30;10.9

BUT, I bought a new player for my car which is a 6.2 "screen which is then in landscape mode, this app is then directly useless in this format as you can not spin the wheel to adjust the time to stand there .. A little optimization in landscape mode would probably have done the trick.;3;2018-06-24;10.9

2363;Bjørnar Andrè Fonn;This is used for all my parking spaces. Fantastic app that simplifies everything with parking and receipts. Paypal lies as a payment method and goes completely painless without being asked for extra login or password! Hair recently had a problem where I was fined when the wrong rate group was entered. This could have been avoided with the use of location service and control. After all, Stavanger and Oslo are far apart;5;2018-06-01;10.8

2370;Janne Røising;Stopped working Now only a tab of the wheel is displayed to select time, the app is impossible to use.

2391;En Google-bruker;Used the app, but was fined anyway. The response to the complaint states that I have paid to the wrong parking company, but the app's logo was on the sign where I was parked.

2406;Monica Johansen Haugen;Miserable and incorrect information on their website. Omits to tell you important details. The customer service is the worst I've been in. Steer clear. Use the machine instead. Not been paying 15% extra in parking via easypark which is not easy by any means. Better help to get via the vending machine.;1;2018-03-28;10.6.1

2412;Andreas Nyman;Easy to use, easy to start, extend and end parking. But I should choose a car before I set the time, because when I get to a zone where I only have to register a car, there is an unnecessary message that I am doing wrong because I do it the way I have to do it in normal zones.

I have a web, but the app certainly does not find it. Thus, the app is useless. Hope you can fix this.;1;2018-02-26;5.9.2
2421;Iven Hansen;When you renew parking with a new day and there are still a few minutes left, parking is suddenly stopped anyway. Difficult to detect when the fine is well placed on the route.;1;2018-02-25;10.5.1
2422;Malin Theodorsen;New version is lousy! The icon constantly pops up on the phone, urging me to remember to end parking !, several hours before it expires! Got a lot worse ... thinking of paying at a vending machine instead ... just get annoyed!;1;2018-02-22;10.5.1
2423;Jan Einar Rautio;Inaccurate on the map in relation to zones. Or else ok;5;2018-02-21;10.5.1
2424;Kåre Moen;Cannon.. bother someone there is a user error 🤣;5;2018-02-18;10.4.2
2425;Lars Skiebe Tarøy;Used this a lot before, until I saw that they put 15% on the parking meter price. I think it's a lot, despite the fact that I only had a subscription without a monthly fee. Had they added 5%, it would have been fine. 15% !! Do not tolerate 😡 Thanks for the response from EasyPark. Yes I know you are a technology company, but I can still criticize, what I call, greed :-) Sum-a-sumarum I no longer use their services. But..good luck :-);1;2018-02-14;5.5
2426;Kjetil O. Myklebust;Although it is my responsibility to make sure to register the right zone, I think it is very unfortunate that you use an inaccurate map solution, which means that you risk a fine when using ... Have always liked the app and the map solution, but now I have incurred me parking fine by trusting that the map solution works. Ended up paying for parking in the zone next to where I parked, which ended in a fine of 600. Was very careful about choosing the zone that the map showed I was in, but it is clearly not enough with their inaccurate map ...;1;2018-02-13;10.5.1
2427;Terje Svendsen;For some shit, does not work and does not take in any way 30sec. Just rubbish;1;2018-02-10;10.5.1
2428;Aksel Henriksen;It is not possible to move the car inside the same zone. will still be notified of the time limit;3;2018-02-07;10.4.3
2429;Svein Ingve Lode;Works fine. But 3kr for pdf on mail - not so good.;2;2018-01-31;10.4.3
2430;En Google-bruker;Heard that it costs 15% more to use the app;3;2018-01-31;5.9
2431;Erling Ervik;Was better before.;2;2018-01-26;10.4.3
2432;Odd Arne Selmer;Draws two stars as the digital clock is gone. Everything else with the new variant is absolutely top notch. But hvooooorfor is the digital clock gone ?????????;3;2018-01-24;10.4.3
2433;Miriam Valøy;Have thought it worked very (!) Well with Easy Park until the new version came. It does not work for me, so I have stopped using it now.;1;2018-01-24;10.4.2
2434;Håkon H;Good, but do not understand why I have to be sent into the app every time I delete the notifications in the top menu in Android;4;2018-01-23;10.4.3
2435;Artur Stune;I will not receive my receipt.;2;2018-01-22;10.4.3
2436;Torbjørn Bratli;Does not work at all. A couple of times it had found the parking lot, but it was not until I got back to the car after an hour. Had to uninstall all the dirt.;1;2018-01-20;10.4.2
2437;Sigurd Sundelius;Great app, works very well.;5;2018-01-20;10.4.3
2438;Еirik;Consumes a lot of battery even when app is not in use.;2;2018-01-19;10.4.3
2439;Odd Erik Sandøy;Quite a decent app. A negative point is that you have to pay for the receipt. This is something you order, which involves waiting time. Answer: No, but can not retrieve receipt from the website.;3;2018-01-18;10.4.3
2440;En Google-bruker;You spin and spin and spin .... Only 2 stars now due to the damn spinning wheel.;2;2018-01-17;10.4.3
2441;Morten Karlsen;Works fine with shorter parking get, but after updating it has become completely hopeless to pay for parking over several days. I have to. Spins and spins. Until I lose track.;3;2018-01-16;10.4.3
2442;Espen Ruud Schultz;The new update with favorites is great, but wish it was possible to see more of the text of the areas as it is impossible to see the difference between Sandvika Storsenter new part and old part 🤪;5;2018-01-16;10.4.3
2443;Odd Sørlie;The GPS does not find the correct zone.;1;2018-01-15;10.4.3
2444;Natalie Andersen;Really miss the old version, now it seems easier to go pay in the machine than to use the app itself unfortunately. Was so fond of the app before ..;2;2018-01-15;10.4.3

2455;Kenneth Frøystadvåg;Simple and easy to use;5;2018-01-09;10.4.2
2456;Ylva Lindahl;1. I miss the digital time setting. It is easier to use than the wheel. 2. I want back the feature that allows me to save the last parking zone. Now I have to find the same parking every time. (Enter the parking lot before I leave home.) 3. I do not want a reminder that I have ongoing parking when I leave the place after parking.;4;2018-01-04;10.4.2
2457;Victor Lam;Maps do not work well, you must always enter the number on the site and after the update, the app does not stop overpayment at Max parking time as it did before.;2;2018-01-04;10.4.2
2458;Christine Saupstad;Was very happy with the app until their update. It was a big step back and I no longer see any reason to use such a heavy wind app. The clock on the app does not match the clock on the phone and has then ended up paying over NOK 100 to stand 30min in a parking lot where it costs DKK 70 per day.;1;2017-12-31;5.8.9
2459;En Google-bruker;Their app is lousy. I do not even get to register, not even after I changed phones.;1;2017-12-30;10.4.2
2460;Rino Kolstø;Good app. Click on for small amounts, but otherwise good.;4;2017-12-28;10.4.2
2461;Olav Alexander Mjelde;Likes the app's intuitive approach, but it does not always manage to renew parking without closing it first. In addition, it uses a little too much power.;4;2017-12-27;10.4.2
2462;Kongtom;A little unsure if I like the latest update. Liked the look and usability better before the update. Possibly it's just a habit.;4;2017-12-27;10.4.2
2463;Steffen Andreassen;Good as long as everything works!;4;2017-12-25;10.4.2
2464;Vidar Nilsen;New disposing of rubbish. Much more clutter.;1;2017-12-24;10.4.2
2465;Trond Morten Haug;The new map selector is not good and makes the app more cumbersome to use than before. One step back for a new version.;2;2017-12-23;10.4.2
2466;Geir Lundemo;The other app was no problem. Now I have problem all the time. Enter code on the box but network errors and errors. This does not hold. Can't use the app now. Awful. Fix the problems.;2;2017-12-23;10.4.2
2467;Roy Inge;Does not work at all on note 8. Permanently warns of network errors on both wifi and 4g. Can't even log in. Edit: Works well now 😀;3;2017-12-22;10.4.2
2468;Rune Helland;The car number one chooses is in small print. Can also not write the name of the car where one chooses parking something that would have been fine when there are several cars registered in the app to avoid choosing the wrong car and thus get fined;3;2017-12-22;10.4.2
2469;John A.;Works well now :);4;2017-12-22;10.4.1
2470;Torge Hjorth;Use this often. The GUI has become much better in the latest version. GOOD!;4;2017-12-22;10.4.2
2471;Erwin Stocker;After the error was corrected, it works fine.;1;2017-12-22;10.4.2
2472;Jan Egil Gjerseth;Everything is reset and nothing works after updating. Fixed now. Good app, but causes a lot of chaos when it suddenly does not work - in the middle of parking in need of renewal. Must be more stable. Updates need to be better quality assured. The functionality is top notch.;3;2017-12-22;10.4.1
2473;Jacob Chr. Rørdam;Works now;1;2017-12-22;10.4.2

2477;Frank Jonassen;Must restart the app to be able to extend the park time. Why change an app to something worse?;1;2017-12-22;10.4.2
2478;En Google-bruker;Terribly bad that you can only use the wheel to choose parking time. Enjoyed the keys much better. Also do not like that it hunts on gps. This should be possible to choose yourself / turn off.;1;2017-12-21;10.4.1

2506;Ronny Madsen;Gone from being a halfway usable app, to now not working at all after the last update. Gets network errors with both WiFi and 4G, not compatible with Android 8.0 ?, feed 10 pro? Or just general incompetence among those who have coded the app?;1;2017-12-21;10.4.1

2509;Knut-Helge Eikrem;Parking with this app is as easy as it can be done. Love the app and love that I can park the car and activate payment m I get from the place. No more walking back and forth from the car to put a patch in the window.;5;2017-12-21;10.4.1
2510;kegge18;The old version was better;1;2017-12-20;10.4.1
2511;En Google-bruker;New app even worse than the old one. Now it is not possible to change the spinning wheel away to keys? The usability of the app is even worse than it was. That it is possible for Ann to create such a lousy app. Now they want GPS to be supported. Should have followed with power bank when downloading this app.;1;2017-12-20;10.4.1
2512;Pål Jørgnsen;The previous version was a 5 stars. When possible and choose whether it was desirable with buttons or and spin the wheel to set time. Get the buttons back! Just a gimmick with that wheel, 90% I choose 1, 2 or 3 hours and stop it when I'm done. This version only reaches a 2er unfortunately. Hope this is something you can fix in the future.;2;2017-12-20;10.4.1
2513;T Bone;Bang that I release these vending machines;5;2017-12-20;10.4.1

2528;André Røstadstuen;No need to think that you have paid for a short time;5;2017-12-16;5.9.2
2529;RoyalHD;Had it not been for the app asking for GPS activation EVERY single time I open or do anything inside the app, it would have received 5 stars. I thought the new UI was very clean and nice;3;2017-12-16;10.3.1
2530;Christian Aaslie;It does not get easier;5;2017-12-16;5.9.2
2531;Tonje Horten;Why do ALL parking lots in the city appear on the map at the same time? Impossible to press on the right parking as there are about 20 up there at the same time .. also the fact that you are more expensive than the vending machine itself is not exactly a plus ..;2;2017-12-16;10.3.1
2532;Kristoffer Carlos Eikeland;I do not understand all this complaint. You sound like a bunch of whining kids. I have no problem with this app or the color. The wheel works just fine and the alarm that the parking time will soon expire is brilliant. All I have to do is turn the wheel and extend my parking time so I don't have to pay a fine. Nothing to put your finger on here no.;5;2017-12-16;5.9.2
2533;Marianne Måseide;Makes it easier to remember to pay.;5;2017-12-16;5.9.2

2538;Morten;Great that there has been a favorite list. But you have to remove the hassle about GPS position ...;3;2017-11-27;10.3.1
2539;Alexander Sageng;I liked the update in the form of GUI and such, but the j ** la hassle of activating GPS could have saved you. If one can rather enable or disable this feature then it would have been good. It also seems that the wheel responds better, and that's good :-);4;2017-11-24;10.3.1
2540;Ronny Hansen;Seriously, what's wrong with your UI designers? The previous version was good, this version bears the mark that bobysocks has won the melody grand prix again with a pink drunken party. Get rid of that damn bullshit and get back the sensible way to record time. And mute that damn pink festival before I spit on my phone;1;2017-11-24;10.3.1
2541;Svein Krogstad;Terribly annoying with the hassle of using GPS. Worked perfectly before the update. 🤔😤;2;2017-11-22;10.3.1

2544;Jan Endre Grytten;Insert so that the boom should open where it is. But now it's gone. Has been notified for each car if the sign is deactivated. But is it not possible to read whole mld because if e presses it it disappears ??;3;2017-11-15;5.9.2
2545;Dag Einar Thorsen;Was better before the last upgrade. Now there is more fiddling and nonsense than before. And that pink wheel does not work as well as the previous solution, as you could click once for an hour or minute. Update: Thanks for the reply. Today it was even worse than before. The app hangs and is unstable. Recommends testing before rolling out new versions. And preferably backtracking to the latest version which worked well.;2;2017-11-14;10.1.1
2546;Padwan4099;Talk about bad updates. Not interested in using gps to find parking area. No possibility to turn off. How do I know if it is a private or company account. Has become like Microsoft, the update does not make it easier.;1;2017-11-13;10.2.2
2547;Knut Ole Hovda;Obs obs !!! The app is decent enough, but it will be 15% more expensive parking by using it .... !!!;1;2017-11-12;5.9.2
2548;Cptbear;Absolutely brilliant app! Once you understand it, this is something everyone really wants! Been to the hospital often, and with this app I am saved from getting a parking ticket forever! 😅😂;5;2017-10-30;5.9.2

2551;Bjørge Bettum Olsen;Do I really want to pay 15% more, for easyPark: to have access to just about all information from my phone - including which WiFi networks I have had or use! No! Is the answer! It is hair-raising simply, neither more nor less.;1;2017-10-21;5.9.2

2560;En Google-bruker;Very good, but be aware that they charge 15 percent in fees. It will thus be 15 percent more expensive to park.;3;2017-09-28;5.9.2
2561;En Google-bruker;Really very happy, but now it will not work. Get notified that something has gone wrong, only the app opens. So right now it's useless!;2;2017-09-21;5.9.1

2564;Tor-Arne Nordbø;Nice and clear app that makes parking much easier. BUT: NB! Why does the app use GPS when it is not opened by me ?! I see look and often that the app uses GPS. Right now, when I sit at home in front of the PC, I see that the app opens to check GPS. This pulls down 2 stars!;3;2017-09-16;5.9

2567;Johannes Kvalevåg;The app works properly when you need it, but uses an unnecessary amount of power when not in use. I have not opened the app in a long time, but still it is at the top of the list of battery usage. Avinsrallert.;2;2017-08-19;5.9

2573;Elisabeth Bowitz;The time in the app is 3 hours behind the actual time. so when I park at 15.00 to 16.00, the receipt in the app shows that I have parking from 12.00 - 13.00.;2;2017-07-25;5.8.9
2574;Joar Guttormsen;Fantastic app that makes parking a breeze!;5;2017-07-25;5.8.9

2576;Raimond André Torgersen;It is not possible to choose 24-hour parking, europarkark charges 65, - on a vending machine per day and easypark 150, - for 24h, you spin the wheel for an eternity and it does not say whether you pay for every hour or fixed daily price that europark has in the relevant place. Useless.;1;2017-07-17;5.8.9
2577;Kim-André Wøldike;The system itself is ingenious and I save money on it in the long run. Unfortunately, this app draws a lot of power when I do not use it .. Is very unnecessary that something I use 1 to 2 times a week should take power from my battery all the other time.;3;2017-07-15;5.8.9
2578;Robin Hansen;Gotta pay ... Buuu;1;2017-07-15;5.8.9
2579;Kent Floberg;Nothing else to report but that this is pure fraud. I logged in for parking, but still should not park in that place, and logged out less than a minute after logging in. It cost me NOK 26, - which was a so-called minimum amount.;1;2017-07-06;5.8.9

2583;Helge Moen;Have used the app for about 2 years. It has always worked for me in use and definitely simplifies the payment of parking, even if it costs 15% extra. The downside is that it uses a lot of power even when not in use.;3;2017-06-17;5.8.7

2589;Mikael Vang;The app costs 15% more than payment on a vending machine, without this being clearly stated! Same with minimum price NOK 5 per parking. The app uses 1% battery per hour without use, and hangs every time after opening after the time has expired. In summary, this scam is wrapped up in a bad app.;1;2017-05-29;5.8.6.1

2604;Vegard;Explain the new accesses ...;4;2017-03-18;5.8.4
2605;Espen Mikkelborg;Simple and clear! However, there should be an alarm function that tells you when the parking time is about to expire. This already exists in the form of an sms service that alerts when there are 15 minutes left, but this is too bad. The app itself should report both 15 and 5 minutes before the expiration time. Easypark benefits a lot from people forgetting the time. With the information the users provide with this app, you can probably track where the users are at any given time as well and structure the control accordingly! I as a customer use your offer and demand that you take care of the customer relationship!;3;2017-02-17;5.8.4

2615;Edita Hoxha;I trusted this app, set parking time. 3 weeks later I get a message: do not contact the bank, pay now or we will send an invoice (NOK 39 in addition).

2617;Pål Jostein Didriksen;Convenient app, except for the cumbersome solution of choosing time (the wheel).

2624;Thomas Hjelme;Please note that easypark charges 25% more than paying manually. And many payment machines have the wrong rate value in the app. Here in Arendal, it cost NOK 10 more per hour to use the app. The app only has 15 minutes' notice before it expires, and this costs NOK 1 per message. Then you pay for 15 minutes or less and you get no notice. Certainly a super app for commuters and workers who are going to meetings. But for private individuals, this app is useless and very expensive. Rather pay too much in the vending machine than to risk a fine with the app.;1;2016-11-28;5.8.1

2637;Fredrik Jensen;Too high a fee that they charge when using the app makes many people shit to use it, especially when it becomes cheaper to use the machine right outside the door.

Stop it, or write an explanation of why.;1;2016-11-15;5.8
2638;Tarjei Sunde;And combines two accounts. A private and job. Via a job account, parking can be invoiced as a regular invoice. Deducts a little due to what is perceived as a little more than a high surcharge / monthly fee.;4;2016-11-14;5.8

2650;En Google-bruker;It is possible to get paid for parking, so that is a positive thing. But it is not very easy to understand and navigate the interface. The Norwegian translation is characterized by unskilled labor. The app does not give an indication of what times there is paid parking when choosing parking time, and who invented the ridiculous wheel?

2661;Dagne Målfrid Åsnes;It is easy to load a car, easy to spin the wheel. It is also easy to enter a tariff group or look on the map if it is difficult to find in the car park, for example. I would like it to automatically ask if I want to choose a longer time if it costs as much to stand ten minutes longer, for example, than what I have chosen.;4;2016-09-11;5.6
2662;Ole M;The wheel you use to set the time is not easy to use, but finally you at least have the opportunity to stop the parking. Thus, you only pay for the time you have actually spent.;3;2016-09-07;5.6

2664;reyh!;Decent application, but easy to fine. Chose the wrong tariff group by accident, was fined, complained, but still had to pay. The only thing I get to know is that "the rules are like that, and OnePark can not be" charged "for this". Very disappointed with a this. Will avoid OnePark and EasyPark as far as possible. Not recommended.;1;2016-08-25;5.6
2665;Trond .Hvedding;Muck app for the muck industry! If you do not know the tariff group (when visiting another city) "offers" the app to find out where you are via "show map" / "location services", I took advantage of this v a visit to Drammen, paid via the app, but was fined , when I complain they refer to some secret terms on a website where it says "We are not responsible for losses, although it is our application that has found out which rate group you are in / where you stand" How about being notified this in the app, when used vs afterwards?;1;2016-08-05;5.6

2693;Gisle Bakken;The app stopped working several hours before paid parking was to expire. This resulted in a parking fine even though I had paid for the next day. Are there parking guards who have created this app? ...... Then I called Easypark. Do not understand why I should.

2700;Jeanette Eidarson Irgens;Pays establishment fee and monthly fee!;1;2016-03-14;5.3
2701;Håkon Økland;This is too bad! Should hurry to the plane and the app can not be downloaded with either wifi or mobile data!;1;2016-03-14;5.3
2702;Audun Dekkerhus;People do not have time for this idiot app! When you can not pay by card you just get cursed and annoyed, I was about to lose the plane because of this idiotic app !! Mannskit simply! Not everyone has internet on their phone everywhere! Great cactus for Avinor in this case too! Not to forget all the extra work for the guards who have to go around typing regnr. on all cars in the square, idiocy !!;1;2016-03-06;5.3
2703;Jan-Erik Moen;1. Incredibly slow to use! Sometimes it just hangs. 2. If it is opened in the parking garage (with poor coverage) it does not help to go out in good coverage, the app must be closed and opened before anything happens.;2;2016-02-29;5.3
2704;Morten Bruheim;Works very well;5;2016-02-27;5.3
2705;monica kolbeinsen;Very user-friendly, handsome and simple.;5;2016-02-23;5.2
2706;Jarle Buerstad;Easy to use. Clear, and gives notice before the parking goes out. Easy to extend parking time if needed, and can exit when you pick up the car. Practical!;5;2016-02-17;5.3
2707;MediaRevs DTV;But was fined due to unpaid interval. Fine + pavgift 580 + 50;4;2016-02-14;5.1
2708;Lars Erik Jensen;I use this app often and every time I have to stop paying / parking the app hangs. Must kill the app and restart each time! Not good enough!;1;2016-02-11;5.2
2709;Odd H Knudsen;Easypark is excellent, and linked to PayPal, so parking has never been cheaper, and zero fines. You only pay what you have to.;5;2016-02-11;5.3
2710;Eirek Gullvåg;Amazing that an app like this can't rotate the screen. When you have a permanently installed tablet in the car that is in landscape format, you see quite a bit of a nap when you have to pay through the app, at the same time as it is difficult;2;2016-02-11;5.3
2711;Inge M. Bjerrang;Nice to have, No need to have coin rattles in the car 👍;5;2016-02-11;5.3
2712;Andreas Brombach;Super app that saves you time and parking guards ☺;5;2016-02-10;5.3
2713;Bjørg-Irene Erlandsen;Very good app that saves time, but still does not like having to pay for parking ^^;5;2016-02-10;5.3
2714;Lars Moe;Finally possible to park without having to reach back before time runs out.;5;2016-02-10;5.3
2715;Bjørn Tore Kjølholt;Finally an app that really makes life easier. I can not do without this. 😃;5;2016-02-08;5.2
2716;Jim Ronhald Graneng Nergård;Easy to use. Can be used in most places.;5;2016-02-08;5.2
2717;Daniel Larsen;I do not need parking very often, but have recently used this app and I must say that it works incredibly well! Definitely worth the little extra charge, as you avoid extra work at vending machines and avoid having visible receipts in the car;5;2016-02-04;5.2
2718;Erik Røyeng;Only downside is that it uses a lot of resources / power (according to my S6's smart manager);4;2016-01-26;5.2
2719;Kirsti Brendlien;Super happy with the app itself, but NOK 3 fee for sending a receipt by email ?? Not good.;2;2016-01-26;5.2
2720;Jørgen Leland;Telefon would prefer to uninstall this app due to high power consumption. Otherwise it is a super app ☺;3;2016-01-19;5.2
2721;Frank O. Heggemsli;Decent app, but annoying and unnecessary that it is more expensive to use the app than to pay in the machine ...;3;2016-01-18;5.2
2722;Thomas Amundsen;Absolutely sick that you add 15% to the fee when using this. So I turn to cards.;1;2016-01-17;5.2
2723;Jon Thomas Hogstad;Do not like the wheel to set the parking time. It moves on the screen when I have to spin the time and there is thus a lot of vase before I finally hit something. Has Galaxy 6.;2;2016-01-14;5.2
2724;Trond Erik Tøraasen;Works simply!;5;2016-01-14;5.2
2725;Sindre Seppola Reed;But one question. Is there an end to the fact that parking can be charged on the phone bill?;4;2016-01-08;5.2
2726;Leif Lohne;Fabulous app. Always use it. Most useful app created;5;2015-12-25;5.2
2727;Cathrine Svihus;Parking is expensive in the first place! Oh this app made it even more expensive! It's nonsense and if the vending machine at the airport had worked I would never have used it! Steer clear, this app costs you dearly.;1;2015-12-24;5.2
2728;En Google-bruker;How did we do without. Releases coins and cards that do not always work. Great when you have a bad time.;5;2015-12-09;5.2
2729;En Google-bruker;Do what it's supposed to do.;5;2015-12-05;5.2
2730;Peter Hamre;Cracking good idea, but does not work satisfactorily. A number of functions such as notification based on location, x number of minutes until expiration (the common denominator is push) only work sporadically. This means that one can not trust it, and thus is just as far.;3;2015-12-05;5.2
2731;Frøydis Folkestad;Needed this when I was in Bergen. Was only informed that "an error occurred". Drop the whole digital payment plan. Received an sms today (5 days later) that now only my card information was missing, and then everything was ready. Well. A little in the last team.;2;2015-12-03;5.1
2732;harald sandvik;GPS function is just nonsense, consumes battery and is unreliable anyway. Easypark takes a LOT of commission and 0 responsibility. Good solution, however, is enough for 3 stars.;3;2015-12-02;5.1
2733;Asgeir Odde;The app shows 1 hour back in time. Tried to update, uninstall, reinstall without success.;1;2015-12-02;5.1
2734;jimmy johnsen;Uninstall this. Does not work. So no. I do not update short info.;1;2015-11-26;5.1
2735;Jørgen Lie;Do I have to pay 3 kroner to receive a receipt by email? It does not hold when I also have to pay 15% overprice on parking. I expect free electronic receipt! 5 stars if it comes in place.;3;2015-11-23;5.1
2736;kristina ruud;When I have to pay it says: ops something went wrong try again but does not work ... fine when you do not have the opportunity to go out to put money!;2;2015-11-19;5.1
2737;Signe Eren Andreassen;It's good;4;2015-11-12;5.1
2738;Maiken Dahl;You pay money for a service from which the municipality receives little benefit. And it is much more expensive to use easypark small. I have saved money by paying for the vending machines. Most places you can withdraw the card when you return and thus you have only paid for the time you stand. Easy park sends an invoice and it can arrive six months later and if you forget it, then it will be expensive for you. Recommends everyone to pay directly at the vending machines. In any case, you must always pay while you are at the car. It says easyparks regulations.;1;2015-11-07;5.1
2739;Kim Hansen;This app uses a lot of power even though I have not used it in 3-4 weeks and try and stop it x number of times then it starts up and uses power it is up to 5% power consumption there is a real reason why this app should constantly stand on? Because of this I would call it miserable. This should not use power other than when it is in use;1;2015-10-28;5.1
2740;Rolf Erik;Does it really cost 15% extra when using the app?;3;2015-10-23;5.1
2741;Storm Melstveit;Great app;5;2015-10-13;5.1
2742;Geir Henrik Styve;Useful ☺;5;2015-10-10;5.1
2743;Alf-Arne Andvik;Used the app yesterday. It worked as it should, but still received 500 fines.;1;2015-10-09;5.0.1
2744;Jonathan Bakken;Otherwise perfectly fine.;4;2015-10-08;5.0.1
2745;Henning Vangli;The app asks you to activate the location service to notify you when you leave the car park in case you forgot to stop the payment. What they do not tell you is that they also track you down long after this. Position logging is running in the background !! This even if you quit the app or restart the phone!;1;2015-10-06;5.0.1
2746;En Google-bruker;Should be the default of the setting with high battery usage;5;2015-09-30;5.0.1
2747;Knut Henning Næss;Works well, but steals 10-12% of my power, even if I do not use the app. Lower the fees and fix the power consumption, and you have a top app ...;1;2015-09-27;5.0.1
2748;Eirik B. Altern;Hopeless when you have to pay more for a solution that is easier for Easy Park;1;2015-09-26;5.0.1
2749;Asbjørn Vang;Does not work!;1;2015-09-25;5.0.1
2750;Geir Inge Øydna;The app consumes power completely unnecessarily.;1;2015-09-24;5.0.1
2751;Carl Christian Strømberg;Uses a lot of power even when it is not active or in use;1;2015-09-21;5.0.1
2752;Erlend Jacobsen;The app consumes power even when not in use.;1;2015-09-19;5.0.1
2753;Aleksander Avsnes;Since the phone itself warns of high battery usage, I see no utility in this app. Bergen municipality has a similar app without fees.;1;2015-09-15;5.0.1
2754;Patrik Karlsson;The app is now uninstalled. It has now at lunch time used 16% of the battery on the phone, then I have not used this app for many weeks. Phone has been rebooted several times since the last time I used the app. There is only 1 system that draws more battery on the phone, and it is the "Android System" itself and in third place after this app comes "Android OS" - it is completely unnecessary to destroy the battery capacity of all phones that have this app installed. But, it's nice to have when I want to park. As I understand it, Easy park wants to log where you are all the time, and for this reason the app is constantly active and sends your position back to "moterhship". But it is possible to install it only when you need it, then uninstall again.;1;2015-09-15;5.0.1
2755;Eivind Bjørhei;Without having opened the app, it has used up 20% of the battery in one day.;3;2015-09-13;5.0.1
2756;Bjørn Eirik Marthinsen;Must uninstall as it consumes power even when not in use.;1;2015-09-12;5.0.1
2757;Jens Christian Werring-Westly;Good that you can pay with your mobile at the patching machine. The app has the functionality expected, and the noise section is ok. But the app is slow and eats battery (10 percent of total battery one day I did not use the app) even when not in use. Here the developers have a job to do.;1;2015-09-10;5.0.1
2758;Runar Olsen;Does it matter if you use Europark and Easypark or? Europark is behind both apps somehow;3;2015-09-10;5.0.1
2759;Nils Magne Lunde;Uses too much power;2;2015-09-07;5.0.1
2760;Raymond L;One of my most used apps;5;2015-09-04;5.0.1
2761;Jon Mjørud;It does what it is supposed to, but it drains your phone of power as it ravages wildly in the background.;2;2015-09-03;5.0.1
2762;Olav Nordgård;But otherwise an absolutely ingenious app 😀;5;2015-09-02;5.0.1
2763;Cecilie Handeland;Works exactly as it should.;5;2015-09-01;5.0.1
2764;Even Hovde;The app can be a little smarter. But parking works and there is money and saving.;4;2015-09-01;5.0.1
2765;Asgeir Misund;Makes payment of parking easier, but wish I could also use this in parking garages;4;2015-08-31;5.0.1
2766;Roger Aune;Absolutely superb app, all that is missing is that it suggests parking code automatically when you open it.;4;2015-08-29;5.0
2767;Magne Olav Aarsand;Lots of money to save here, because you only pay for the time you spend and avoid fees. Works well too.;5;2015-08-29;5.0
2768;Steffen Thomassen;Slippery to charge for using the app, 15% more expensive than using the machine. And this you will not be informed about until after you have installed the app, rudely you ask me. No thanks, I said !! Stuff the app a certain amount of space.;1;2015-08-18;4.9.1
2769;Theodor Onarheim;In short, great. Updated frequently.;5;2015-08-17;4.9.1
2770;Mudassar Iqbal;Very useful. If you have EasyPark then no overpayment, parking fine and zero stress..Recommended;5;2015-08-11;4.9.1
2771;Irene Eriksen;Especially when you are in the hospital a lot ...;5;2015-07-14;4.9.1
2772;Kristian Bornstedt;They have previously written that it is 10-20% more expensive with the app, on the grounds that this goes to zero because you pay for the current payment, today when I downloaded and had to try the app for the first time, the price was NOK 14 for 30min while manual rate was NOK 12 / hour, so either thieves who take a lot for running the app or there are some obvious and significant errors here that should be fixed;3;2015-07-09;4.9.1
2773;Anni Berglund;Great app;4;2015-07-02;4.8
2774;buzter111;Very good. Recommended!;5;2015-06-25;4.8
2775;Morten Rasmussen;... on my Samsung S6 (pdf receipt via the website itself is also very convenient). Advantage of being able to store several tariff zones. Can be used almost everywhere in Norway. In addition to Denmark and Sweden - Morten.-);5;2015-06-15;4.8
2776;En Google-bruker;It is called parking fee not parking fine! It's not a fine, it's a fee you get! Have the correct vocabulary in the description. Aiming at the description of the app: The safest solution for dropping coins, overpayment and parking fines. "Again, that's a fee!;1;2015-06-02;4.8
2777;Nathalie Sandnæss;Fight decent app, avoids the hassle of having small change on you all the time.;4;2015-05-26;4.7
2778;Jan Kvam;This is a superduper app, but - even though I "kill" it, for some reason it starts up again and goes in the background - even though I have restarted the phone a couple of times. So it sucks power: / (according to my battery app);1;2015-05-17;4.7
2779;Pal Kvam;Parking without money, smart😀;4;2015-05-16;4.7
2780;Jon Ole Segerfeldt;Excellent app;4;2015-05-16;4.7
2781;Thomas Lone;But consumes battery. Uninstalled until next update;2;2015-05-10;4.6
2782;Per Erik Martorina;Consumes battery after last update;2;2015-05-09;4.6
2783;Tor Vinje-Christensen;The service is good, but the latest update of the app consumes battery. Will now have to uninstall and wait until a new fix is ​​in place.;1;2015-05-08;4.6
2784;Kevin Foust;Very happy with the service but after the last update, the app has been active in the background and thus eats the battery in a few hours. Does not seem to be useful to quit, so I remove the app until this is fixed.;3;2015-05-02;4.6
2785;Cengiz Elkoca;Great app;5;2015-05-02;4.6
2786;Andrea Søndervik;Got a parking card even though I had paid with the app :-( Expect it to work out, but it was not very convincing ...;1;2015-04-20;4.5
2787;Tommy Meyer;Parking is expensive enough as it is. That EasyPark charges for more than the parking itself is nothing short of shameful and slick.;1;2015-04-10;4.4
2788;Geir Engen;No need to go out and spend more money to extend the time. You just adjust on the app. And you also avoid paying too much. You only adjust the time on the app afterwards and you only pay for the actual time you spend.;5;2015-03-23;4.4
2789;Jonny Hjortland;15% (min NOK 4) is a high fee. Parking that may cost NOK 10 will then have an effective fee of 40%. And NOK 3 for a PDF receipt is a little incredible considering that it does not have a direct supplier cost.;2;2015-03-20;4.4
2790;Natasha Elisabeth Thomassen;But who bothers to pay 15% extra to use the app? Then the whole point of avoiding overpayment is gone ..;1;2015-03-18;4.4
2791;Christoffer Dyrhaug;Too bad we can be fined in some places even if you use the app. Pvakt may not be able to check the database;3;2015-03-14;4.4
2792;Martin Bergsvåg;Works fine so far. Slightly slippery with the krone surcharge for notification. Should be part of the app. But nice to not have to run around to put in new tickets when the time expires and good that you can deduct the time that is not used.;4;2015-02-20;4.3
2793;Charlie Hulthin;It is ridiculous that it should be more expensive to use the app than to use the "old-fashioned" machines. Should have been the opposite. Paid 402.50 with this app at a parking garage in Oslo for 19 hours parking. The daily price for the vending machine was NOK 350. Fix this, then I'll give better scores.;2;2015-02-10;4.2.1
2794;Kaveh Darafshi;Works very well, as long as the mobile has coverage in the basement parking spaces 👍👍;4;2015-01-21;4.2.1
2795;Trond Hauge;More expensive to park with the app. NOK 20 with coins and 24 with the app at the same time.;3;2015-01-19;4.2.1
2796;En Google-bruker;Super;5;2015-01-17;4.2.1
2797;Rita Hansen Genc;Awesome app. Can get longer easily, and quit whenever I want. Is fantastic. And financially. Often pays too much the old fashioned way. To be sure :-) very good !!;4;2015-01-16;4.2
2798;Erik Tessem;"Parking ticket" made easy, simply. And with a private and job profile, it becomes very clear and easy to park for any purpose.;5;2015-01-15;4.2

2806;Eirik Strande;Very useful app. How about loading QR scanner?;4;2014-11-22;4.0.1
2807;Trond Tunheim;After the last update, it comes "Oops! Something went wrong ...." after entering the parking code. Nice if this can be fixed so that the app can be used again.;3;2014-11-09;4.0

2810;Yngve Benning;I had this at the very beginning. 2002-3, and then you had to have a mark in the windshield, and then you could pay and extend by phone or text message. Was brilliant then but this I much easier ...;4;2014-10-24;3.9
2811;Frode Hanøy;Absolutely idiotic that it should be 15% more expensive to use the app to pay, against regular payment! Boycott !!;1;2014-10-21;3.9
2812;Ina Gabrielsen;Incredibly nice to not have to think about coins or overpayment when I park in the city. Most zones now have easy parking and it is incredibly easy to use the app to pay for parking and then get a bill later. Have saved a lot of money on parking with this solution!;5;2014-10-08;3.9
2813;Elin Dalen-Rasmussen;Best ever;5;2014-09-26;3.9
2814;Thor Jensen;It only gets worse and worse after the updates. Constantly notified to log in. Spends more and more time opening. Whether this is due to S2 is possible. Had the app worked as intended, it would have received 5 stars.;1;2014-09-16;3.9
2815;Jan Tore Iversen;Toppers;5;2014-09-13;3.9

2821;Joakim Lundby;15% more expensive;1;2014-08-07;3.8
2822;Lars Ove Stava;A lot of looting to register a user. To select parking time, you must spin a "wheel of fortune" that does not have numbers. How do I know how much time I have? Here you get no discount for not using coins, it is 15% more expensive !!!;1;2014-07-28;3.8
2823;Petter Aarsand;Simple, but cost more than using cards, and it provokes me so much that I consider using cards instead. Why should it be more expensive with the app?;2;2014-07-26;3.8
2824;Kevin Myklebust;Best app I've used. Has been the rescue in Sweden as well, on vending machines that did not take cards and where I did not have cash;5;2014-07-22;3.8
2825;Sigfrid Ørjansen;Do you have problems pulling the card on the parking meter, or do not have coins to put on? Easy Park is the solution! Easy to use, change and quit whenever you want. :);5;2014-07-15;3.8

2836;basir ahmadi;Very bad. I have internet but trying to buy p'-bills app says no internet connection found. Annoying if I get fined. As long as you do not get fined in such cases then the app is a relief.;3;2014-04-09;3.6
2837;Kari Wie;It's the most ingenious thing I've been up to in a long time. Currently a lot in hospital and before I had to run in and out all the time and now I have the whole machine in my pocket - great :-);5;2014-04-04;3.6

2839;Anders Botten;Should use easypark today. But did not get confirmation from the app that I had bought parking time. So I used the vending machine and paid NOK 15 with a normal note in the window. ... A little later I got a message that my parking lot is going out soon. . And that means I have paid double !!!!;2;2014-04-03;3.6
2840;Fredrik Rostrup Ellingsen;Comment on previous posts: does NOT cost several hundred kroner per month to use the app. Private customers pay + 15%, while corporate customers pay NOK 59 per month. In the long run, you save money since parking can be stopped when you return to the car.;5;2014-04-03;3.6
2841;DannyTheKid;It's EasyPark's Easy Money! They require a fee / subscription to have this agreement if you are to use their service. Before, my company had an agreement with them, then we had a sticker on the route, which we could call in via mobile to start / stop P-time. Ingenious can be said to save money, they said. The problem is that we had to pay several hundred kroner / month in the subscription for each car that is registered with EasyPark's register. Hold on tight! This app probably has the same function and the same profit for Easy Park - Easy money !!! But we have now dropped them to save money instead. Folks! Drop Easy Park and save money !!! Also avoid P-company parking traps where there is no information in the App that tells users about max. Parking time in that zone or a limit to max. Parking time. You can pay to EasyPark for 5-10 hours for a parking zone where you are ONLY allowed to park 0.5 hours. When you could also extend the parking time via mobile, which in certain cases exceeds the max. Parking time in that zone without knowing or remembering it. It can also lead to P-bot or what? Roger Stalheim had probably experienced that. The app gets 1 star for, EasyPark 0 star for greed.;1;2014-04-03;3.6
2842;Bjørn Atle Solbakk;Works well, and receives sms 15 minutes for expired time;5;2014-04-03;3.6
2843;Trond Torsøe;If you could choose between private and work when using the service, all receipts to the employer could come on a printout ..... Then it would be an extra star .... Could have been the same price as for others :-) Easypark could received their share from the parking company ... These save the card fee and wear on the card reader B-);3;2014-04-01;3.5.3

2847;Alexander P;The app itself seems ok, but is not relevant to pay extra. It is not SO cumbersome to pay at the vending machine.;2;2014-03-31;3.5.3

2850;Knut Kjesbu;No, no ..... this should be cheaper than paying on site ...;1;2014-03-26;3.5.3
2851;Vidar Larsen;Incredibly good app. It does not get easier and you do not need a subscription.;5;2014-03-21;3.5.3
2852;Vemund S. Mellevold;Requires subscription. This is irrelevant.;1;2014-03-19;3.5.3
2853;Rashid m Elatyaoui;The app is good in itself, but you could save the users the extra fee when paying. Then it is actually worth the "detour" to the parking meter.;2;2014-03-13;3.5.3
2854;Robin Johansen;Have no problems with it. Nice with this app when you never have little money.;4;2014-03-08;3.5.3
2855;Kjetil Solvang Carlsen;Have not received a parking fine in recent years I have used easypark. The extra costs for parking save you money by just paying for the actual time! The app is perfectly ok.;5;2014-02-12;3.5.1
2856;Hege Irene;The reason it only gets three stars is because their wheel can be completely on the blueberry ride at times.;3;2014-02-11;3.5.1
2857;jjamtli89;No need to pay for the time you are not parked. Start and stop the parking time with your mobile, and you do not have to stop by the parking machine.;5;2014-02-07;3.5.1
2858;Sadie Tuter;Start stopping and extend your parking time from the phone without using the vending machine. .delicious to avoid defective vending machines.;5;2014-02-06;3.5.1
2859;Christian Magaji;Liked the idea of ​​being able to pay easily with a mobile phone. But when they have 15% in addition to parking fees or monthly fees, this app was quickly uninstalled !!!;1;2014-02-05;3.5.1
2860;Vegard Viken;The only thing missing is that when you receive the receipt you can SEND TO (email etc ....);4;2014-02-05;3.5.1
2861;Knut Torgersen;The colors in the app are horrible and the extra cost of parking should be covered by the parking company.;2;2014-01-18;3.5.1
2862;Asgeir Storesund Nilsen;Works perfectly!;5;2014-01-16;3.5.1
2863;Jon Bronken;Would be perfect if it worked everywhere and if it did not cost extra for multiple accounts.;4;2014-01-16;3.5.1

2871;Geir Jonny Flatnes;Used this for the first time in jønkjøping. Very smart to pay with no need to look for the vending machine. Must have easypark where you park.;5;2013-11-22;3.4
2872;Linda Ervik Sellæg;Ingenious concept, but a little too often I experience 'network errors' so I can not log in .... :-(;4;2013-11-20;3.4

2875;Rita Helene Brevik;But. Too bad you have to use visas and the other choices. Strictly speaking, not everyone has a visa. Why not have the option to add to mobile invoice? Would love to use this. But it does not help;1;2013-11-16;3.4

2882;tom idar nilsen;After resetting the phone, I was not able to log in or change my password so that I could use the app. Tried to add me as a new user and then came to another menu and then ordered a new password so I could recover my user. This should be fixed soon.;4;2013-10-05;3.3
2883;Henrik Elkjær Hagen;Does not accept Visa credit cards from Skandiabanken. App seems a bit unfinished. Too expensive! Does it really cost + 15% ?? Can accept + SEK 1 per. Parking.;2;2013-09-26;3.3
2884;Bertil Arntsen;Very convenient!;4;2013-09-10;3.3

2886;Stian Indal Haugseth;The concept is good but the app has shortcomings. Once I have entered a rate group, car and started a parking, I find no way to put them in favorites. You have to enter the favorites manually.;3;2013-09-02;3.3
2887;jossemann;Excellent!;5;2013-08-30;3.3
2888;Mariann Berge;Very satisfied! Easy to use :);5;2013-07-29;3.2
2889;Arne Birkeland;Works fine with my Samsung S3, just a pity that my municipality is not connected to EasyPark, only Europark that I can use it on.;5;2013-07-26;3.2
2890;Freddy Myrås;Works great. Seems to me that there may be money to be saved with this.;5;2013-07-25;3.2
2891;Frank Ove Nilssen;This is very good;5;2013-07-23;3.2
2892;Jon Arnesen;That they let anyone park with the app at all is a quantum leap. The interface is really well thought out. congratulations;4;2013-06-24;3.2
2893;Tore Jenssen;Very happy with the use of this app.;5;2013-06-19;3.1
2894;En Google-bruker;Do the job, but prefer that you can use the app without GPS. Experienced slow on newer phones.;3;2013-05-21;3.1

2898;Tord Strømme;So easy that it's fun to park. Only misses the opportunity to print / save a receipt. Saving to Google Drive would have been ingenious.;4;2013-05-10;3.0.12
2899;En Google-bruker;How does it work with passwords. ..have never made one and will come when I open that I have to make a new one due to invalid. .. ??? What to do ???;4;2013-05-08;3.0.12

2909;En Google-bruker;This app does what it is supposed to, but the start-up of 20+ seconds and the generally slow interface is a decline from previous versions;2;2013-02-20;3.0.9
2910;Jon Faller;Works flawlessly on S3. Has saved me a lot both in parking fee and fines already (due to minus overpayment). User-friendly, but used zones should pop up in a clickable list, so you do not have to enter a zone every time. Otherwise smart and easy. The app means, for example, that you remotely control the parking from the doctor's waiting room, the café, or from home if you have left the car in the city the night before, etc.;4;2013-02-14;3.0.8
2911;Henrik Ulvesæther;Ingenious application for those who never have coins, or who tend to over pay. Works fine on Samsung S3. Cozy customer service representatives when ordering. Highly recommended.;4;2013-02-13;3.0.8
2912;Stahl Stenslie;Why use the app when it costs 15%?;1;2013-02-12;3.0.8

2918;Henning Morten Lorentzen;The concept is great. The new app is idiotic.;4;2013-01-04;3.0.2
2919;En Google-bruker;works poorly ... has used it in Sweden, works ... does not work. 1. must be given the opportunity to save zone no. 2. must work every time 3.

2920;May-Liz Dale;This app is just super :-D;5;2013-01-02;3.0.2
2921;Stian Laursen Skoglund;This is an excellent apply, but unfortunately Europark destroys the whole point of the app. They have decided that they do not have time to check the license plate number on the car against Easypark's service to verify whether you have paid or not if you have not pasted the windscreen with the Easypark logo. This only applies to a selection of parking spaces, Nydalen in Oslo is one of them. Apart from them, it has been a dream to use the app :-D;4;2012-12-18;2.2
2922;Ståle Storheil;One of the best apps I use.;5;2012-12-17;3.0.2

2935;En Google-bruker;... and I'm annoyed. Stupid to pretend you have a good mobile solution when it costs so much. When tel. and sms does not work, so you have to subscribe?;1;2012-01-22;1.0

2950;Carsten Jens Arnesen;A click on the page can stop the parking time and flip and you will be fined. Even if you try to make a new payment, the fine may come in the meantime. The app provides false security.;1;2020-04-10;15.4

2975;Aribakhan;The app works around Norway and you can stop or increase your parking time in a second. You don’t have to be in the place where you parked your car… can do it easily from anywhere as long as you have the parking time still going on! If you save the parking zone number you can still start a new hair parking! No need to run to extend parking. Parking finish reminder also pops up well in time. Stress free!;5;2021-10-07;15.28.0

Like to be notified before the parking goes out or extend the parking if you need it.  No, I remember well in the past when you had to plan the parking based on how many coins you had put on the machine.  Eventually, I hope the large parking spaces can have the opportunity to take a picture of sign number when you come and go.

Before EasyPark was just automate, and the parking hyenas waiting round the corner.  The parking companies didn’t start such off systems for many years because they loosing many on it.

EasyPark and the parking company refuse to take responsibility for this. Great stuff!;1;2021-08-03;15.24.0
3044;brianrkf;EDIT: Thanks for your cheeky response, EasyPark Team. Unfortunately it was their app that made the mistake and not me, that's why I'm very annoyed. I chose the right zone (without time limit), have extended parking 2 times and the app only ended parking 25 minutes early, without any error message or without me doing anything to control the app to end parking… Do not know what customer service will help me with then. Should I send you a signed confirmation from 3 family members who saw me extend the parking? I can try, then I can share my experience with other users here!  If there is any "hidden", illogical or unintuitive way to end parking that I was not made aware of in advance (as other 1-star reviewers here point out), then it is again just bad design in their app. Users can not read developers' thoughts.  —-  The app confirmed 2 TIMES that I have demanded parking from 12:15 to 12:30 and then to 12:45, still I was fined NOK 600 because the parking was closed by itself at. 12.25, have no idea why… I simply feel cheated! What's the point of using this app (and paying 15% extra) when the result is that you get a fine anyway?;1;2021-08-02;15.24.0
3045;SebastianOslo;Using this app actually makes parking in Oslo more expensive then using the official app.;1;2021-06-25;15.23.0
3046;Freddyfena;Can definitely not recommend easypark. It is not enough that you charge an extra fee, as much as 15% in commission when paying P! The app is not very user-friendly and does not notify properly. Parking can be interrupted or never started for no reason even if it says it is running. Only the hub is so jargon that every sensible person should stay away. Change the name to "Park at your own risk" And when you talk to support, they will not understand that something is wrong. The customer has all responsibility and it is of course the customer who made the mistake and who thus has to pay a fine :-( Should uninstall the app immediately and warn everyone I meet.;1;2021-06-22;15.22.0
3047;Låtveit;Leads the way in development and especially with support for carplay, misses getting the same map as in the app there, otherwise very good.;4;2021-05-17;15.20.1
3048;Juksogfanteri;Basically an app that makes parking easier. BUT, be careful to confirm roof zones. Always double check these !! Have experienced that the app suggests the wrong roof zone. Then there will be a fine, even if you in good faith think you have paid for parking. Also gets no reduction in fine despite having paid.;3;2021-06-20;15.22.0
3049;SmåFrustrertSjåfør;Is a parking in Ski where the gps in EasyPark shows two areas with their code side by side, the gps placed me in one area and since I have not had any problems with the app until now, I completely trusted this. But after I had returned to the car and was going home I found a "nice" and yellow strip on the window… NOK 600 is not something I am ruined by, but I think it is completely out of the question that I as a user should be loaded because the app is not so up to date that it removes areas / codes that are obviously useless or invalid.  Hope the app can be updated relatively soon so I and others do not have to search high and low to find out which codes are valid and can be used :);2;2021-06-16;15.22.0

3051;Theodor es;Miserable app that spies for money. Due to a mistake I came 1 min over 2h free parking and then had to pay 21kr. Contacted them but they thought I just had to pay. If it costs NOK 21 per minute, then probably only billions can afford to use this app. In order not to get a higher bill, I went in to pay, but found out afterwards that I can not even delete my card from the app, so just have to cross my fingers that I do not get any extra expenses.  Completely hopeless how they are doing. Hope no one else falls into the same trap, so ALWAYS check if you have not scrolled Christmas a little too far, because it will suddenly be very expensive.  Has now deleted the app, but can obviously not delete the user on his own. So they should have absolute control over you.;1;2021-05-27;15.21.0
3052;alle kallenavn er jo i beuk;Decent app, but there have been several cases where the app has been much more expensive than a regular vending machine.;2;2021-05-24;15.21.0
3053;arildji;"It has never been so easy to park in the city," writes the developer of the app. It has also never been so expensive to park in the city: in very small print it says that the developer of the app takes a 15% surcharge in addition to the parking fee. Vipps, overnight it became 15% more expensive to park when the parking company switched to this app.;1;2021-05-23;15.21.0
3054;Superhelten;The developer obviously lacks the ability to absorb anything other than bragging. A number of Easypark users are calling for clearer information that parking paid for with the app is 15 per cent more expensive than with alternative payment methods. Easypark dismisses and believes users need to read The Little Scriptures better. Many users have also complained that Easypark pulls for the same parking several times. I am one of them. Again, the developer rejects everything as a user error.  I myself immediately contacted customer service when the app notified me that my parking was about to expire - several days after I had purchased a 24-hour parking. But here I could thank myself. The developer maintains that I as a user must understand that active 24-hour parking does not appear on the app's opening page, as other parking does, and that the user must orient themselves in the submenus, find out if Easypark has charged the user for more than one day, and then take contact customer service before the first 24 hours have passed. User error, that is. And definitely no weakness in the app.  This could have been a very handy app, but the developer's arrogance ruins the user experience.;1;2021-05-19;15.21.0

3113;Yuna86;In recent months I have received error message 11341 every time I try to park somewhere with "Camera Park". My wife has received the same error message. When we have called EasyPark, they have said that it is because someone else has entered the car in their app and activated camera parking, and that only 1 person can have the car in the app. Both my wife and I have tried to delete the car from the app without any help. Now it turns out that someone who borrowed the car a few months ago naturally put it in the app to pay for parking, and that is the reason why we are not allowed to use the app. Suggestions for developers: Write more informative error messages than type "Error.Message.11341". A message like "2 other people have added this car to their app. It can be in an app at most" would have been very helpful. If possible, allow several people to enter the same car, with camera parking activated. If that's not possible, let me see which other users have put the same car in the app, with phone number. Remember that many people rent out their car via nabobil.no or Finn.no. You do not necessarily know who added the car to the car unless it is stated somewhere.;2;2020-08-07;15.10.0

Okay, but instead of the customer service representative arranging, they blame that they can not do anything when they handle this for another company. When they also try to indicate that the car has been moved (even though it is only the mobile that is now in another place), it leads to you choosing another solution next time. Too bad, the app is probably fine after you get used to it, but the customer service manager means that it can not be recommended to others, especially the elderly who may not get it right away.;1;2020-05-29;15.6

Notification with push, sms and email before parking time expires and when parking is completed.

It is completely silly that the options you have in the app are no receipt, or subscribe to daily receipt emails for NOK 3 each.  When you plan to use the app instead of a payment machine, the receipt must be available free of charge in the app. I have not shopped anywhere this decade where I have to pay for an electronic receipt - it seems nonsense.;1;2019-07-02;13.5
3193;alexoidus;Lately, don’t know which version precisely, there were introduced a new feature for el car charging symbols. I thought it was convenient until today, when I was charged a parking fee plus a penalty for illegal parking. The basis for it is a new “matreshka” style parking. So instead of just park’n’pay you need to run an investigation on a site to clarify which part of parking lot corresponds to a zone number, sure thing that serves only one reason: to charge extra. Even though “fraud” is a bold definition, I sincerely believe that is a proper word to describe latest initiatives.;3;2019-07-01;13.5

EMBARRASSING!  A bit of an answer. Are you aware that with your answer you just argued against automatic sign recognition in car parks?  This is easy. The whole of Europe is working together on standards on signs. The structure of the signs, maximum length and which characters may be in the signs. It is only laziness that prevents you from implementing a security check in the app.;1;2019-05-17;13.2

For information, we are both relatively technical, so the technique of handling the app is basically no problem. The problem is that the app lives its own life when in use.

3218;Vilde S. Jensen;Hi! The app is very handsome and light-hearted, really useful for a busy everyday life! One thing I think could have been an improvement is this with the choice of car and registration number. Here it is very easy to make mistakes as a user, which for me and many others has resulted in a fine - despite the fact that you have actually paid, but for a registration number that does not exist or a car that was obviously not in the parking lot. One idea could be to have a two-step registration of car numbers, so that it is easier to detect errors in registration if these two do not match. Or possibly a check against a register, which means that the registration number that does not exist is not approved by the app, and checks if the first two letters are in the registration number at all. Personally, I missed "f" and pressed "r" in a hurry - and "NR" does not exist. But the cure was there, because this was my fault, which I agree with! (Despite the fact that I think the parking attendant should have looked for the car he had paid for, and not found this, and then looked between his fingers and thought "here is someone who has been human to misprint in the app".) By improving it I have mentioned above, I think the app would be more "foolproof" and even more would have enjoyed and trusted the app, and that parking attendants do not have to take the brunt of the user's mistakes - which is often awkward to admit as a user :);3;2019-03-03;12.6

When I leave the car park at the same time as I am registering parking in the app, it has jumped to the neighboring car park, which is a maximum of 30 meters away. When you are not known, it is not easy to know if you are choosing the right zone. And ergo you get a parking ticket because you have entered the wrong zone, which may be as little as 10-20 meters away from the one you have parked on.;1;2019-02-13;12.5

Opened the app and there was no parking. Had to look up to see if there was a patch on the route, thank God it was not, thought maybe I had forgotten anyway. Driving home, and after about 1/2 hour after the actual parking has ended, I get a reminder that the parking will soon expire. Was then deducted about 75 kroner for something that should cost about 35, seen from previous parking lots in the same place. I give myself plenty of time on the app in case something should happen and do not want the parking to go out until I finish. Have used the app a lot, especially in the last year and a half, never experienced that the parking that has begun has disappeared. Really hope I don't have to experience this again.

Stupid that you can not enter the parking code and start parking from the clock, and when I either put in the time or try to finish, I only get error messages. Even if the parking is closed from the phone, the app will not update on the clock and shows that the parking is active. I think the developer should fix this as people may think they have valid parking and get fines. Remember that you are well paid to develop these solutions, and then you should jaggu me develop them properly or pay someone else so they can do it for you. Clearly you do not care much about the apple watch app for so long. Hope this changes in the future as it could be a perfect app to have on your wrist.;2;2019-01-03;12.0

3249;amcarmom;The app itself is very user-friendly What goes down horribly is that you can quickly get a parking ticket if you are not vigilant. In other words, do not use this app if you have a bad time, are stressed or not. When you park the car, the app will find a parking machine for you and you will have an opportunity to pay. There are several vending machines near each other and the app is just as happy to give you one that does not belong to the parking lot you are in. Once I was parked with several people, I had paid correctly but three friends were fined for their cars next to mine because they had paid at the wrong vending machine I have now been fined myself because I have relied on the app in stress. I have done everything right but have paid for an appliance that was a little further away and not for what belonged to my parking lot. This was in the same parking lot and with a few meters in between So sum summarum, the idea around the app, usability etc. is very good but it can quickly become expensive to use If you want to use this app, you must each time go to the machine you find in the corresponding place you are in and then manually enter the machine ID So it does not hold to see the machine "over there" A good - and necessary, I mean - change on this app had to be that it on the map showed ALL the P. machines around where you stood, not just one!;2;2018-12-12;11.7.1

I even managed to hit the wrong parking lot due to minimal distances between two of these.  That I should have checked, there is no doubt that I should have done, I like to take self-criticism. But a parking area without a visible border that separates two different parking spaces is in my opinion relatively meaningless (still profitable for you :-)) The correct parking space was less than 10 meters away from my parked car and should mainly cost me 12kr. 7 minutes later - 612kr.

3280;Jømle;Using the App costs 15% more than paying with, for example, a card at the machine. Information about this extra cost is given in VERY small print on the information poster by the parking meter (has one picture from the machine at location 7127 in Ålesund as an example, but may not attach it as an appendix in this review). It is important to be aware that the surcharge of 15% gives a significant additional cost for parking over a longer period of time. When using, for example, payment by card at a vending machine, parking can also be terminated earlier so that the use of the app does not provide any cost savings (unless you temporarily drive in / out of the car park during your stay and want to end parking payment for the period you are out. parked for more than 10 hours per day, you should still pay for one day and then there is not necessarily any savings when using the app .... maybe rather the opposite);2;2018-09-04;11.2.1

3285;Laukis;15% surcharge for using the app is completely unreasonable. To defend it by saying that you take 30% too much on average of your customers is otherwise nonsense.

3287;pengwen;It is a shame to see that an external player is needed for parking providers to give users the simplest solution and reduce their administration themselves.

Without the ridiculous price increase, I would have easily given five stars :);4;2018-08-04;11.1
3288;dpkra;This app costs me a parking fine because it took the wrong code for the parking place. It lacks a proper check for what you type in for parking code. The parking code of 3 or four digits are prone to mistakes in typing and complaining to easypark does not help as they are not the one renting out the parking lot. Easypark is not interested to improve the app as Europark makes more money with errors of the user. Strongly recommend to write these complaints so that the app gets improved. Parking lot codes should not be very similar. I had to type 9445 (Sandnes) but easypark app registered 944, which was a parking lot in Oslo.  Called immediately when I saw the fine in the window of my car. Everybody makes typing errors on the mobilphone. The software should be better and only a numeric keyboard should be given (similar when I use the Bank ID on my phone) to reduce the change on typing errors.  Finally do not use this app. Please boycot it until improved. My comments to Easyparc should be valued the 600kr fine!!  The answer of Easyparc is that they all have 4 digit codes. I am 100% sure that I did not type 0944. How can then 944 be written on the historic confirmation of my payment. See for yourself!  Good luck with your App👎;1;2018-08-28;11.2.1

3307;Knut-Olav;Overall very happy with their app, but one thing that should have been better  Parked rental car in Italy, and so marked. Great pleasure and ready to pay with the app and have the same functionality as usual.  In the app I was asked about reg no, and with a rental car and Italian sign I was told that this was probably not true (probably since I was Norwegian). Could the pressure continue, but not sure if I had done something wrong, there was payment with coin this time as well  Proposed solution  How about having your own functionality for a rental car. Put the car in a time-limited period (because you do not want it on your list) called rental car (or borrowed car). Ask when it is entered which country it is registered in, and verify the sign against this country.  This will make the world much easier for us who travel a lot and rent a car;4;2018-07-05;11.0

3336;Geirser;Fantastic. Stop leaving places to pay or due to parking gone out. 
1 point of appeal. After the overhaul the app got a while ago this happened: Got up the correct car number, but forgot to press it, so then the parking did not start and I got my first fine in 4 years (think it is as long as I have used EasyPark). Realize that you have to confirm, but what about a function that alerts after 5 minutes if it looks like you have tried to start a parking?  The app still gets 5 stars because it makes life easier the way an app should do.;5;2018-04-07;10.5
3337;Kamfs;I like this app very much, as I can stop and extend the parking time from the mobile. But I have some criticisms:  After the last update, you removed the digital clock, something I can not understand. The wheel is very cumbersome, especially if you have to park for many hours or days. See that you have previously answered other comments here, that it should come back at the end of January. I can not find it.  Then I have to say that I am skeptical that customers have to pay you 15% of the parking fee. It is in the highest team. If you know of other digital solutions (eg bus), you get a discount for buying a ticket digitally. This, or at least not a higher price, should also be the case at EasyPark.;2;2018-03-13;10.4.1
3338;Spotanomalies;At the time of writing, I have been sitting in the car for 40 minutes trying to make the app work, without success. When I tried to pay by calling Easypark, I was informed that the telephone service was closed for the day. When I tried to call customer service, this phone service was also closed for the day. There are also no vending machines to put money on. Finally, I had to call Europark in Oslo and read out my card details to get paid for parking outside my home in Tromsø.  Whether it's a temporary bug with the app or not, I'm really kidding, as there SHOULD be alternative payment methods in case such a thing should happen.  Useless.;1;2018-04-05;10.4.1

Especially for free zones.  After praise and suggestions, there will be some rice. You now have 2 «buttons for search, it's just clutter. Let's look up both addresses and code in the same interface, search is search.   You should also find a more elegant way to take charge or inform better.

3365;JoachimBarrum;The app is still worse than before. You have fixed the iPhone x interface that is good. But that the app does everything it can to select a parking space automatically is too idiotic. It should be a secondary function as it is not to be trusted. Many parking spaces are often very close if you make a mistake quickly. My wife was fined just because she had chosen the wrong automatic parking space. Boring to pay for parking AND fines when much of the reason is a confusing app.;1;2018-01-16;10.2
3366;RogerPapps;It is incomprehensible that you do not get a partnership with the parking companies instead of charging extra. Buses, trains, etc. give a discount for digital purchases you take extra. So it holds too.  How did you manage to remove the digital clock? Fancy with wheels, incredibly impractical.

3372;Altvarmyebedrefør;Can't find a tariff zone even if you are in the county's largest car park.

Scripture is intertwined and is at times hopeless to read  And to clarify with a view to the answer from the developer: No, zoom is not activated No, I can not choose afterwards No, there is no help in sending mail to a place that does not respond;1;2018-01-08;10.2

Out of my own laziness, I did not know that EasyPark imposes a fee for using the app. I am now moving to Bil in Oslo to avoid the extra fee. Thank you for me EasyPark!;4;2017-11-21;10.0.3

3391;timmi2;To become a member, it costs more than NOK 300 in establishment fee. Luckily I checked the Easypark web page first. It's way too expensive. It is a fact that the parking companies are greedy. The app is hereby uninstalled !!;1;2011-08-24;1.1

3403;Pondus73;For the last month or so, this app has not worked on my Iphone 6s plus. iOS and apps are updated. All that happens is that the app quits immediately without me being able to use it at all. Is it just me ??;1;2017-11-26;10.0.3
3404;FruKomini;The previous one was easy to use. The new one has become much worse in use for me (IPhone 7). The map often fails to determine the location, but when I enter the code, I also do not get the keyboard to be able to type. Not satisfied!;5;2017-11-26;10.0.3

Now I experience that I spin the wheel, click on start ... the usual beep comes (which indicates that parking starts) BUT it does not. I have experienced this twice now. The first time it went well but yesterday I was fined. When you create an app that CLEARLY DOES NOT WORK AS IT SHOULD, it works against its purpose. I'm not angry, but very very disappointed. It was a good solution before, but now I ABSOLUTELY do NOT recommend it.;1;2017-11-22;10.0.3

3410;Andersbra7000;The app worked fine before, but the latest update with that spinning wheel is not the best. It's ok for short term parking, but if you are going to pay for several days, you have to spin and spin for a few minutes to get to the finish line. Not impressed;2;2017-11-20;10.0.2

3433;Daniel Løvås;Simple and good solution for paying for parking. No need to go to the vending machine, and if I meet good people at a restaurant, and stay longer than planned, I only increase the parking time with the app. No need to return to the car to enter a new ticket.

3437;Miksch;Using this app can cost you more than you want. You can register several cars, but what they do not state is that you can only have one car parked at any one time. If you have started parking on a car, and your company has another car at its disposal that is also to be parked elsewhere, parking of the first car will automatically end and then start parking on car no. 2. This has resulted in me suddenly having the first car without valid parking fee and none of the users were aware of this bug. Everyone can imagine the consequences.  In my eyes pure scam. Steer clear of this app !!  Would have liked to give zero stars, but that is unfortunately not possible.;1;2017-09-22;5.9
3438;bjornar72;Good App, but if you want to get people to use the app, there can be no extra fee for use. Then people pay with cash / cards ... Should rather be cheaper with the Easy Park app !!!;3;2017-09-19;5.9

3443;Caos82;Great solution, but in these paperless times, such an app should make it cheaper to park. When you need parking every day, it amounts to NOK 4 per. once in a year quite a lot. This means that this app can not be used by me.;1;2017-08-16;5.9
3444;ArneSolheim;There are not many apps that are "must-have", but for those who drive in Oslo and Akershus, this is just completely gold. You are guaranteed to avoid fines as you can extend the parking period whenever you want. Also uses it in all places where there is 1-3h free parking, then I do not have to download a note, at the same time as the app supports the grstis period.;5;2017-05-11;5.8.6
3445;Eikand;The app sends advertisements as a notification, so you can not use notifications.;1;2017-05-19;5.8.6
3446;Skuffet bilfører;DO NOT recommend this app further. Have not had problems with this app before, but had it on Wednesday 10 May. There were no reports of technical faults and that the parking had not been started. This resulted in a parking fine. NOT okay! Not much help to get from customer service. Major changes must take place if this app is to be used with me again.;1;2017-05-12;5.8.6

3450;bjocy;This app is difficult to use. Make sure the parking starts! I got a parking ticket while using the app. I followed all the steps, got the information on how much the selected time would cost me. I accepted, but this is not enough. You must also start the "meter". Since it is necessery to go through a bunch of steps before it starts, like entering the registration nmb, entering the payment zone, confirming the price etc, you should think that the app would let you know that you had not completed the registration before you leave the lot.;1;2017-05-09;5.8.5
3451;Bjostein;Very simple, just to spin for a couple of hours, never mind how long you stay .. go after 30min to get notice when you leave the parking area so you can stop parking.

3456;Utviklerensol4;Miserable app that is slow and confusing. In addition, must pay 15% premium.;1;2017-01-07;5.8.3
3457;Haraldseid;This is a mobile service that takes advantage of the fact that you do not have cash and / or that the car park does not have a card machine. They advertise that you save 30% by using the app and thus can end the payment at the exact time - therefore they can charge 15% of the price for you to use it. It's way too expensive !!;1;2016-12-28;5.8.3

3468;Roar Johansen;I went on a bang due. preselected car number. I started parking with the app only to discover a yellow strip on the windshield when I returned. The reason was that when I last used the app I had parked my wife's car ... Thus I had to pay, not only the parking fee, but also NOK 300 in fees ... An improvement of the app would be to pre-select the most used car number, and not the last used . Last used parking space is perfectly OK.;4;2016-05-22;5.5
3469;Mmarvin8;Very good :);5;2016-07-12;5.5
3470;FrisV75;There was a lot of old negative publicity here ... no registration fee.

3484;Vidar82;Have used the app for over 2 years, I have been very happy until it once stopped a parking I had posted. After about 30 min. out in a 7 hour active parking failed the app. It ended my parking without me being notified. I contacted customer service who for 3 rounds denies that they have made a mistake and fell back on the fact that there must be a user error. Not only is the app unstable, but they do not admit it. They disclaim all responsibility and the customers suffer financial damage.  It's a shame the concept is good, but Easypark as a company can not be trusted.;1;2016-04-21;5.4.1
3485;Oiknvdtukkkøpurfhklp;This app saves me too much! However, if I want a function that allows me, for example, to set a start time tomorrow at 08:00, it seems unnecessary to have an alarm on to start parking.;5;2016-04-11;5.4.1

I miss that it does not tell me what time it is fee or not, but it does not charge when it is free. So it's really going well.  That it also sends me a receipt by e-mail is very convenient the times I have to keep the costs on the travel bill.  Highly recommended !!!;5;2016-03-23;5.3
3504;HallvardM;If you pay at a vending machine, you will receive a note in the window of the correct car. If you have several cars in the app, it is far too easy to choose the wrong car, and thus be fined. This app will then be a pure expense.;1;2016-03-16;5.3

3506;Vvs engineer;After using the app for a while in a company context, there is suddenly a bill from Easypark of a few thousand kroner, so it was money they should have per month (125, - NOK / month per user) to use at all the app. Parking is obviously up there again.  A cost that has never been mentioned anywhere, you only find out when you get an invoice for it.  About. It costs 20,000 a year to just have the app on the phone. Others that structure themselves in the same way are the so-called catalog sharks (google it).;1;2016-02-23;5.3
3507;Tharlis;This is a very good app. Has made life easier when you need more time, or if you drive from the parking lot earlier than expected. Here is the money to save. I could still imagine that you as a customer could choose between paying with a visa or taking the payment on the phone bill, as you can with other apps such as Skyss etc. This would make the app more useful.;4;2016-02-17;5.3
3508;Tjqxjecj;I was fined for not having a visible ticket in the windshield, even though payment was made correctly with Easypark. Too bad that this concept does not work completely, since the idea is otherwise very good.;2;2016-02-22;5.3

3513;gSvoren;Easy to use, fast interface. Likes that you can easily extend the time if it becomes too scarce. Even better, I like that you are not charged for more than you spend. Get in the car. Stop parking. Paid.;5;2016-02-16;5.3
3514;Laier;Saves time, money and frustration.;5;2016-02-16;5.3
3515;Morten83;This is really a "must have" app. The answer to the question: "do you love Easy park" is clearly NO, but I like that at least with this app I only pay for the time I am parked. Good design and quick to use. Also plus for notification before the time runs out ..;5;2016-02-16;5.3
3516;Pål Espen Dybvik;Have been using the app for a while, and I wonder why more people do not do the same. The app has saved me a few kroner, when a meeting, dinner or coffee visit to the city has suddenly taken a little more time than planned. Give the app a try and you will definitely think "why have I not fixed this before ....".;5;2016-02-16;5.3
3517;Mereteda;Very easy to use, easy to avoid walking around with coins or cards to pay in the vending machines that spend 100 years reading cards and printing out parking tickets. Had received 5 stars if they had managed to enter a way to "favorite" different parking codes so that you do not have to go to the vending machine to find out, it is also not everything you can remember in your head either 🤗 It also hangs up sometimes when you have to turn the wheel to add time. ✌🏼;4;2015-11-30;5.1
3518;kjellvisen;The app works fine when it first WORKS! I often use it to charge the electric car but get 50% of the time a warning about "network problems"! It is a crisis for us who MUST charge to have electricity on the electric car! :(;1;2016-02-12;5.2

3522;Guttaperka;This app costs 49 kroner a month to use as a private customer, in addition to 8-16 kroner per time you park. This is very poorly stated when you register your credit card in the app! The app works usably, but the price is completely beyond and must go down.;1;2015-12-15;5.2

3526;Hoffern87;There is nothing about the registration fee of SEK 149 or NOK 59 a month on the app. Sending an SMS with a roof group is just as easy, start and stop, but unfortunately Europark, which I accidentally parked at Istad, does not offer it.

3530;Goddiegoddiegoooooood;Ingenious app when you have a bad time! Generally ingenious app but ...... Minus with this is 15% surcharge and when you want to pay for example in the middle of the night so you do not have to get up at 9 to remove the car, it does not take into account that it is free until 09. If you pay at 01 for 2 hours then you have paid until 03 o'clock and not from 09-11 !!!!! Completely ass 😤😣 If they manage to fix this and reduce the surcharge price a bit, this is an app I would have recommended further;3;2015-08-12;4.9.1
3531;cramsvik;The idea is good, but a 15% surcharge makes it too expensive to use! Especially if you are going to stand for a while in, for example, Oslo. Probably fine for those who send the bill to the company, but for private it is too expensive.;1;2015-07-25;4.9.1
3532;Anders den store;I think it's a good idea with an app that allows you to pay for parking directly from your smartphone. But for me who has a company car operated through Leaseplan, I do not have the opportunity to let parking costs go through anything other than the fuel cards. EasyPark does not allow you to enter a card payment with e.g. cards from euroshell. As this works on the machines, I see little reason why they should not be able to solve this in the app. Costs for this should not be a problem with the costs they charge for starting up and using EasyPark.;1;2015-07-18;4.9.1

Why charge a large fee for notification by text message and receipt by email ... 'Smells' deception the whole scheme. In addition, it is still not possible to use the app in zones in Oslo municipality where resident parking has been introduced. It is not possible to enter a time e.g. between 09-11.

3539;MikkeBoomBoom;The app itself works fine. But EasyPark adds 15% when you use the app. Little information about this in the app and on the web.

3540;Rune1502;The app works fine, but be aware that it costs 15% extra to pay with the App than with cash or card! Pretty hefty addition. There may also be problems with data coverage in the parking garage, but that is not the App's fault.;3;2015-01-06;4.1

Because you will be fined when you have used the Easypark app, then you waive the right to complain about the fine if it is the app's fault or user error.

3575;2vwi;Very happy - nice to not have to go back in the car with a note, and to be able to arrange payment quickly / on the way to what I need if I have a bad time.

3579;Supgxtk;Would get a full pot (5 stars) if you had the opportunity to put what you wanted on "give me a notice when there are 15 minutes left of the parking time".  Easypark enables the extension of the parking time from the mobile and 15 minutes is the time you need to put on more coins, not the time you spend going into the app and extending the parking time. I therefore suggest custom notification time, possibly 5 minutes, which is more in line with the whole concept of this app.  Otherwise a very good app :);4;2014-02-22;3.5.1

This is clearly an app that means that you no longer have to stress to the car because the time in the car park expires, just to spin at Christmas and extend the car park where you are without having to run to the car to add a new patch to the route.

3598;interfacedesigner;I downloaded and used the parking app Easy Park. As it appears from the app, I left a note visible with "Easy park" written in the car until the wafer arrived by post. I used the app's location service to find the tariff group. I do not know the exact address where I parked and chose the rate group that resembled the parking lot. All offered tariff groups gathered different types of parking, of which 2 out of three were entitled "Garage" and I consequently chose "Street parking" instead since I was parked outdoors. As it appears from my history, I have paid for hours and expensively for the place, but by using the place service I have chosen the wrong rate group. The guard who imposed the fine on me did not know about "Easy park", despite the fact that he imposed fines on the area, nor did he take the time to check surrounding tariff groups if this car had paid. To closely analyze offered tariff group titles or memorize a multi-digit tariff group digit readable but undercommunicated a good distance away at the vending machine, when a location service on a mobile (!) App is offered, is not ok. When complaining, Easy Park points out that one should read the terms of the app closely, and they do not go back on the fine even though they can see that I have paid. This is an app with helpless appraisal categories that make you dependent on precise address knowledge and that you go to the machine to double check. On top of this, the company has lousy customer service, and a poorly managed collaboration with EuroPark which imposes the fines.;1;2013-11-15;3.3.1

BUT ... this is of course not the case: - /  As soon as you have gone through the registration process, and been notified that you are done, you will come to a new form where you have to fill in much of the same info again.  After you finally finish (again) you can use the app. It works well, but has potential for improvement. What about scanning the regnr, lookup of place based on postal code, or pre-filling based on lookup on telephone number / birth number?  It also adds quite hefty - enables server communication in background processes instead of better ux.  The "Give us feedback" form does not work. Nothing happens. Slightly ironic ...  All right, but let someone other than the developers test the apps before they are released! Then you discover this before release.;3;2013-07-13;3.2
3621;Dårligx2;Idiotic to have to pay extra when using the app. Will not be using this service! 15% is a robbery!;1;2013-07-08;3.2
3622;Ekbtog;Good mobile coverage, but still I got BOT because it was not possible to log in, due to system error. I try to log in to pay at 1020. The time for BOTEN is set to 1020-1023! Great way to pay, but create an app / sever solution that works every time you log in.;1;2013-07-04;3.2

3626;mbjorndalen;Hope there is an update so that the app does not continue to be so slow! Should also be possible to choose the number of wafers you want to order for us with more cars! But as I said, a brilliant concept but an app that hangs too often!;1;2013-06-26;3.1
3627;BjørnDM;Have been using the app for a few days now and it is doing as it should. Easy to use, the parking time notice expires and allows you to manage the customer relationship from the app.;4;2013-06-25;3.1

3642;Ksjon;... Even if it stops working after 3.1 update. This is otherwise solved easily by deleting the app on the phone before it is downloaded again ...;1;2013-05-26;3.1
3643;henrikll;App no ​​longer works than splash screen - and they do not exactly communicate to customers that the latest app version does not work or when a fix is ​​in progress;1;2013-05-26;3.1
3644;kiddkødd;This started as a very up-and-coming app with between 4 and five stars before you on the latest version make it so slow that I risk a parking fine before I have gotten in and the app starts. Now in the last update you have actually managed to make it useless! Now I do not get started at all ... But you get 1 star for great color and logo on the start page. Impressive that such a, relatively, simple app can start so slowly.;1;2013-05-25;3.1
3645;Bjerkus;Finally, you avoid overpayments and jogging trips to get to the car before the parking goes out. Delicious!;5;2013-05-22;3.1
3646;provocateurs;Using it every day  Recomended !!;5;2013-05-13;3.0.12
3647;frieil;Now this is almost perfect as a tool. But still does not get top marks due to lack of editing ability for the favorites (trash can does not work. Possibly a bug that needs to be fixed). To you who think that this is free: In the long run, it will be cheaper than risking a parking fee if you have not returned to the car after the parking time has expired. Also: If you receive a fee, even though it is registered in the system that the car is legally parked, it is easier to complain about incorrectly charged fees. And: This is a company that has an agreement with a huge number of owners of parking spaces both here in Norway and some other countries. It is a great advantage to have an agreement here at EasyPark. :);4;2013-04-26;3.0.10
3648;Norwaybuford;Simple and efficient, you only pay for actual time and much easier to spend when you drop a bunch of small receipts. SMS notification is good. Only thing I see is that when the app runs in the background it hangs up when there are 35 min left.;5;2013-05-04;3.0.12
3649;eriarn;Have used service for a number of years and mostly satisfied. What does not work for me is the app. Only gets the message that the app can not connect to the network. Have been in contact several times with customer service without it helping. So now the app is deleted and back to the phone service 😡;1;2013-05-02;3.0.12
3650;Mr.Qee;Super good! But I wonder if it is possible to have either 2 accounts or 2 bank accounts you can switch between in the app, so you do not have to enter new login info every time .. Nice if you have a company car and private car and want to charge according to it ...;5;2013-04-28;3.0.12
3651;toroh;Recommended;5;2013-04-26;3.0.10
3652;FredrikDude;The start-up fee for the service is NOK 149, but you can have several vehicles on the same subscription. Has saved me too much time! Incredibly flexible to extend parking time from an app, instead of running out and buying a new parking ticket. And if you return before time runs out, you cancel parking from the app, no overpayment;5;2013-04-26;3.0.10
3653;Hoystad;I highly recommend this app.;5;2013-04-21;3.0.10
3654;Nyfrelst bruker;Great app! Now I can control the parking time from my mobile! And by the way, the review that someone posted before me is untrue, it cost absolutely nothing to become a customer when I registered in the app! The app is recommended for everyone!;5;2013-04-18;3.0.10
3655;Wakeupmann;No more stress to reach your car in time. The best is no more overpayment as you stop your parking time when you reach  your car,;5;2013-04-13;3.0.10
3656;Sfinxern;Why does it say that the app is free in iTunes, when you have to pay an establishment fee of NOK 149 to use it? I call it good old-fashioned deception. Here, of course, EasyPark should have taken this fee as the price of the app. You can not use it until you register and pay for this. I find this very reprehensible. You trick customers into downloading the app and then locking them through a forced payment service. This should be terminated soon! To everyone else: pay via the parking machine with a card! It's the cheapest.;1;2013-04-17;3.0.10

3662;Jørgen Aasland;Requires some registration, but is ingeniously easy to use!;5;2013-04-03;3.0.9
3663;ToVsam;Seems the whole thing is great. Does not have a pink patch in the window, it is discreet white with a blue border. Could have been smaller, trifle.;5;2013-03-28;3.0.9
3664;Spinner34;Considered a year before I signed up. After 1 month of use, I do not understand why I waited so long. Brilliant! And the small surcharge is just sooooo worth the money up against the stress of taking care of and running back to the car again before time runs out.;5;2013-03-26;3.0.9
3665;Flickname;This is great service, but the GUI is lousy. Where you choose the zone the field is tiny and the wheel which has no value takes up the entire screen. The button for GPS the same. Rather, redesign the design to have the latest selections as buttons and use the drop down on time selection. It is easy to choose zone, not time as user-friendly here.;5;2013-03-25;3.0.9
3666;Dagfino;Wish me only a specified receipt monthly, which I can forward to the employer.  Now that I enter "purpose of parking", the solution is absolutely super.  - Faster: No need to stand in line and mess with cards and coins - Smoother: Ends or extends parking time as needed;5;2013-03-25;3.0.9
3667;TorsteinHyl;I love the easypark concept, and use it regularly at work. But I dislike the app. I only come across small things such as the way you enter the zone number (why not mark the number that is there before), or that the text "spin to select time" meets you every time you use the app (when you use the app several times a day you remember it ...). Have never got the correct zone number by pressing the "nearby" button, possibly I have only had bad luck with the places I parked, but it does not work the first five times the threshold is a bit high to give it more chances. Fortunately, it has become easier to spin to the exact times after the previous update, so they should be praised for listening to feedback. That said, can not quite put my finger on why it is an app I dislike, maybe it's just a design thing ...;4;2013-03-10;3.0.9
3668;Krhaugb;Ingenious app if you are not a fan of paying with small money. Works great!;5;2013-03-22;3.0.9
3669;Ronnien77;Good user interface, easy to use to deliver as expected. Zero coins that need to float around in the car.;5;2013-03-22;3.0.9
3670;PaulHarald;I was fined for parking because I typed one of the four digits in the tariff group incorrectly. The code I entered belonged to an area in Tønsberg. I was in Oslo. Although it is my fault that I entered the wrong code, this should not be possible. The phone knows where I am, but not EasyPark. What about the error message "Are you absolutely sure you want to pay for parking somewhere other than where you are?";1;2013-03-18;3.0.9
3671;Øyar;Uninteresting with sticky note in box. It should be possible with this digital parking payment solution per mobile, which in itself is very desirable, to get the service without the company's advertising label in the box. I will use the scheme when the system is delivered without a sticker in the windscreen;1;2013-03-10;3.0.9
3672;Incicon;It's so nice to just be able to add time without going to the vending machine, and in addition not pay for a minute longer than I actually park. Top app! Only it will be possible to share an invoice in a company and privately, and that you can get the notes on the invoice and it will be perfect! The only downside is the tosa sticker on the window. A slightly more discreet color would have been preferable.;4;2013-03-08;3.0.9
3673;Ocin71;An ingenious app that makes parking a breeze. The app is still a bit too slow. It takes a little too long to open it, and when choosing parking time, the "wheel" is too slow and does not reflect the iPhone's otherwise fast response. When Q-park also joins the agreement and the App is fast, it gets 5 stars.;4;2013-02-28;3.0.9
3674;Magic bean 2;I do not think I bother this: 1) get something sent in the mail (!) Wait wait ... 2) wallpaper the windshield with a pink sticker 3) go to the payment machine to find a code (then a bit of the point disappears). The app itself probably works fine, but the concept has too high a threshold for others than those who use the solution very regularly.;2;2013-03-02;3.0.9
3675;Linda Kjølstadmyr;Best app :)) Convenient and simple.;5;2013-02-28;3.0.9

3677;Xantos285;The Easypark app is absolutely ingenious and one of the ones I use the most. It got even better with the new version, except for the wheel you choose time with, where the old way was better. GPS location to find tariff group works poorly, it does not find the correct number.;4;2013-01-23;3.0
3678;ladruurdal;Easily :);5;2013-02-20;3.0.9
3679;Lucas milio;Easy to use and useful. 15% is too much I think. Most vending machines today have a solution where you can draw the card if you drive out earlier than expected. In this way you pay exactly the amount and nothing extra.;3;2013-02-10;3.0
3680;RihannaGirl;EasyPark is a bit more expensive (15%), but means that as long as the phone is with you do not need money or a Visa card. You receive a text message 15 minutes before the parking time expires, and can thus extend the time from the dentist's chair or where it should be. Too bad EasyPark is available everywhere you are required to pay a parking fee - then the parking inspectors would be unemployed and the fines would almost be gone!;5;2013-02-10;3.0
3681;HgsdFan;I am super happy and think it is fantastic to be able to extend the packing time from the middle of the queue at the doctor's office or at a store! You pay for the time you stand, and for me it does not matter that it costs 15% extra. How often have I not stuffed vending machines with coins to avoid fines if time runs out from me, and wasted money by ending up driving long before time runs out ?! I am addicted and highly recommend all my friends and acquaintances to get started with easier parking. 😎;5;2013-02-10;3.0
3682;Kar1-Norway;Works very well. + Reminder when time is running out. + -You pay exactly for how long you have been standing BUT costs a little more, as much as 15% more !! Should have been lower. -The ceiling for how much you can park for is low and the card is deleted immediately, which is annoying and some extra work. Should change !!  ***** But this weighs in that you have a lot of control over.;5;2013-01-31;3.0
3683;JanVill;I have been using Easypark since it was launched many years ago and have loved the service ever since. Very fun that you follow up with an APP that seems to seem just as simple and elegant.;5;2013-01-30;3.0
3684;Bardoien;Undoubtedly the future way of paying for parking. Drag a wheel to set the time, and press the stop button when done. The greed that drives the parking lot is in this way cheated for the excess pennies. When you do not arrive on time, you just spin the wheel a little longer. Hopefully, you will thus avoid that nuffe-nuff on commission spews yellow patches across your route more contrary to what you have stood for a minute over time. Here, the industry largely cannibalizes itself. Beautiful to look at, but also feels good for the wallet.;5;2013-01-26;3.0

3697;Quingamo;Many good long-lost features finally appeared in this version. Good work! At the same time, I think the new design is more messy and less self-explanatory than the old one. Here I am thinking especially of the time wheel. Here it seems like someone has tried a little too hard to come up with something fancy that in my opinion just takes up too much space and is confusing to use.;3;2013-01-15;3.0

3700;IdaAmandaS;Like the new update, mn think the wheel is impractical. Called customer service the other day and was then informed that there will be an update that allows you to choose the wheel or. the "old method" so that you can enter the time manually as before. Then it will be perfect.  Clever that you can also enter cars and tariff groups yourself and make nicknames for them. the note field on each parking lot is a good way to keep track. All in all, very happy!;5;2013-01-11;3.0
3701;Hans Kåre Solli Reinsli;Is easy to put down the car, go into the phone and set the time tariff zone, if not enough it can expand parking without and go back to the car😄;3;2013-01-11;3.0

3703;Gaggis;New update: The app has been upgraded and is now close to perfect! GPS function has arrived and you can enter favorites. Glorious! EasyPark has saved me a lot of money and paying for parking has become almost fun!  Update of previous review: Yesterday I sent a new email about a non-functioning app to EasyPark. I got an answer today and during the day and after a reinstall today it works again! Brilliant!! Also get a receipt on sms !! Now only GPS function is missing so the app gets top marks from me !!  Previous mention: I use EasyPark diligently and have saved large amounts on parking. Arguments that it costs a lot to use EasyPark do not hold if you park a lot and for example are a lot in meetings with a somewhat uncertain end time. EasyPark is an ingenious solution and the app worked well to begin with, but for far (!) Long now it has not worked properly. I wrote an email to EasyPark about this several months ago where they replied that they are working hard to fix this. It turns out (obviously) that is not true. The concept is ingenious. Had the app worked, it would also have been ingenious, but now I only use the ring solution until further notice. When the app is updated and the receipt + GPS function is also included, the app gets top marks from me, but when will the app be usable again ..?;5;2013-01-10;3.0

3736;Diego S;All day without allowing access to the complaint query for an error that tells you to restart the app or cancel it and reinstall it ... After doing both, the error persists and says to contact the developers but the app does not respond either to request help ... Result: when I get to the car I find a fine that I can no longer cancel ... Epark worked a thousand times better and was a thousand times faster to check tickets and complaint notices ... I use it because there is no alternative;1;2021-10-12;15.28.0
3737;Rafael Requena;Without any kind of warning, the app has hung, it has not taken my ticket and when I got back to the car I had a 60 euros fine ... and now what do I do? ... the responsibility is mine of course, I use an app that fails and I am fined ... because we have an app that is left over and does not do its job well, so I recommend everyone to desist if they do not want to pay undue fines;1;2021-10-11;15.28.0
3738;Luis Tori;Application with 10% commission and excessive minimums. I feel cheated by the app since I went from e-park to easy park when it was absorbed thinking that they would maintain the same conditions and I find that this app charges brutal management commissions after 1 year and quite covertly, since Either you give the payment detail at the time of parking or you don't even know about it. I have searched and there are apps to park in Madrid without commissions, so .... Goodbye Easy Park.;1;2021-10-08;15.27.0

3741;Victor Manuel Corcoles Cutanda;Very easy to use. I have been using this App for more than 4 years. Easy, intuitive, it works well ...

3755;Alquiler Audiovisual AZ;Please. Do not lie. In Santander (I don't live there), but, on vacation, you can recharge your balance countless times in the same geolocation. Then they give you a fine, it turns out that you allege that there is a small print on a corner and it says that you have to change the street car so that you do not get a fine since there is only one area. Result: fine + no return of money paid to Easypark.;1;2021-09-30;15.27.0
3756;Cristina Martínez;They gave us a fine in Santander having the ticket active with this app. They are not responsible for the management of the fine, since they say that we could not park for more than 2 hours on the same street although the application allows you to continue paying for parking. When we claim, they neither take charge of the fine nor return the amount of the parking that should not be allowed to recharge. There are much better and more reliable apps.;1;2021-09-30;15.27.0

3766;Sara RaiSun;Disproportionate increase in app cost for short-term parking, when you want to renew the ticket in small strips, the App charges the rate again.

3775;juan carlos rodrigo;App that desistalo, before it had epark that became easypark, starting to charge fees for parking in Madrid. For 5 minutes they charge you € 0.10 in fees that they invent, for that I go to the parking meter. Also, I have € 0.35 of balance left to park and it won't let me spend it if I don't recharge more balance, it's a scam.;1;2021-09-23;15.27.0
3776;Laura Durán;To begin with, I could not transfer the balance from e-park to easypark. In addition, the app is more complicated by having to use location (which does not always work) and not only with the license plate, as was the case with e-park. Finally, the 10% recharge seems excessive to me. In short, I would not mind paying a surcharge if at least the app will work well and more intuitively. The older people I know can't get hold of it.;2;2021-09-22;15.27.0
3777;Carmen Paule Dominguez;It seems to me a scam that I don't let you disappear and they keep your money. For that I put a ticket that is cheaper on top.

3783;Elena Fernández;Updated on 09/20 in response to the comment: in the starting price of the app, I was already charged more than 8 euros for 4 hours. in the blue zone, to which your service cost was added. However, the 10% bonus appeared on the machine and it dropped to € 7. I had to use the app because the machine did not take the card. I insist: bad app. My car is new and has a 10% discount when parking in Madrid. It has not been reflected in the price they have charged me. I will not use it again.;1;2021-09-20;15.26.0
3784;Luis Miguel Gil;It works well;5;2021-09-20;15.26.0
3785;Pepe Quemasdá;It does not allow to disappear in Gerona. It is embarrassing that you do not have this option that you did before. If you park thinking that you can stay up to 2 hours, but in 10 minutes you are there, you lose everything overpaid. A shame of usury on the part of EssyPark. The towns that use the app are not marked on the map, not even the affected payment areas. For me very bad app and service.;1;2021-09-19;15.26.0
3786;Álvaro Ortiz Grinda;My first experience was bad, but after talking to customer service they have satisfactorily resolved the problems I had and now I see the app perfectly. I totally recommend it;4;2021-09-19;15.26.0
3787;Miguel Angel Segovia;Easy to use, fast locating zones and alerts you before time runs out. 100% recommended Today 9-17-21 I ran out of balance on the card I use for this, the system stopped my account, I recharged it and in 1 minute it was activated again, it saved my day and I was able to continue working. Oh, and I don't think it's bad if they charge something, the work has to be paid for and with what makes it easier for us not to have to look for the machines it deserves it, I will continue to use it, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS APP.;5;2021-09-19;15.27.0

What happened to me yesterday is that the system did not notify me of a voidable sanction, as it indicated to me when I put the license plate of my car there was none, something uncertain because it could have been canceled. Regarding my other criticism about the system not allowing to stop when it clearly says "stop", nothing has been answered. Thanks. I'm not from Madrid, I'm from A Coruña.

3832;BEATRIZ GARCIA JARES;It seems wanting is going to be better than it seems, a disappointment. According to them, you have the option of being notified of sanctions, (beware € 3 if you spend time, after about 2 hours, then it goes to € 60 that you have to pay in Abanca) and actually one day I spent 30 minutes and you do not have the option to deduct it from the application balance, directly in cash or card.

3865;EUGENIO;Commission too high, especially to park for a short time. Minimum 18 cents. There is no prepaid option, only PayPal or card, they ask you for too much personal information that I do not think is necessary.;2;2021-08-24;15.25.0

3871;César Bg;They erased the previous assessment, but come on, I once again put that with the mandatory change from e-park to this one, the balance I had disappeared, not to say that now they add costs that there were not before. An impudence, come on.;1;2021-08-23;15.25.0
3872;magdalena Moriche;I do not recommend it. They took away epark that was free and with this they charge us for the service. That which they said that in Coruña they were not going to charge. We don't deserve this.;1;2021-08-22;15.25.0
3873;Alicia Nieto;The app does not serve to extend the parking time once the maximum 2 hours are met, as explained in its operation. Once it is finished you have to go back to the car park to geolocate your car and start a new car park. They also charge to use it, so it is more to pay at the parking meter.;1;2021-08-22;15.25.0

3879;alejandro G;I consider it a scam to have to pay a commission of 10% + VAT for the use of this application. I use other blue / green zone payment apps in various cities in Spain and it is THE ONLY ONE that forces you to overpay. I will not use it again.;1;2021-08-18;15.25.0

3886;R.

I had to remove the payment by PayPal. It does not work well. In a payment of € 1 for parking, I have received two consecutive charges in PayPal, one of € 1.70 and another of € 1.91. A total of € 3.61 for € 1 parking. Then I have canceled the payments with PayPal and uninstalled the application.;1;2021-08-13;15.24.1
3887;Lázaro Redondo Cano;My experience: frustration. Estepona does not deserve this. I use the parking lot every day and it doesn't work.

Well, since then and until today, August 2, they continue to send me daily payments to the card for the same amount. When my car is 100km from the area. I don't see that logical or normal. I give it a star for not being able to give it negative stars.;1;2021-08-02;15.24.1
3915;Sergio Ramos;It does not seem difficult to handle, but it would be very useful for when you travel, to know the prices of the areas. The seety app already does it, I would like something similar to be incorporated.;3;2021-08-01;15.24.1

That roulette does not work well for me either, there are times when after selecting the time it does not let me advance and it does not tell me the price and I have to go back and start over. In answer to what you tell me, on another day I tried to put it in for 1 min and it already charged me about 24 or 26 cents, I do not get the accounts of what you say.;1;2021-07-12;15.23.0

It is a small city and in the end you always have the car close by;2;2021-07-12;15.23.0
3973;Paloma Vr;It is useless t they fine and it does not warn you, it is more it lets you put the ticket when you have already been sanctioned. then you go for the car and you find the ticket.

3974;Alvaro Lav;Scammers! I just realized that there are other apps for tickets. It is bleeding that they charge 0.39 / 0.43 cents for an hour just to use the app ... I have a hybrid, I notice it much more (you pay 50% less. One hour in the green zone is 1 euro. With easypark they are 1.43 !!) A mega robbery! I downloaded another app and it is worth 1.15 ... which is already money. But not the easypark mega scam. Do not use it! It makes me laugh that they say that the eco discount does not apply ... and even so it is not 10% ...;1;2021-07-10;14.6.1

I filed a complaint with customer service and they tell me that the city of Madrid does not conceive of returning an amount once the parking lot has been started.

I also recommend that if the time expires and you want to put the car parked in the same place again, it gives you the option to renew it without having to look for the car on the map. Sometimes I have not been around and it makes it difficult for me to find the street on the map.;3;2021-07-05;15.23.0

4010;Victor M.;All wrong: - It is chosen for time, instead of money. With e-park you chose the amount to spend, and the app indicated the maximum time. In this other way, sometimes you pay the same for a certain time as for the same plus five minutes. - Minimum commission of 18 cents per ticket. Even if the ticket is for a couple of cents. In other apps like Telpark it is 3 cents (in Madrid). - It does not allow to eliminate the means of payment if you do not put another one. - There is no way to delete your own account.;1;2021-07-04;15.23.0
4011;Jero Ariño;When you install the application it does not say that it has management fees. They have charged me € 0.44 for 2 hours of parking, which with another application would have been € 3.60 instead of € 4.04 that I paid with EasyPark.;1;2021-07-03;15.23.0
4012;Isidoro García Liébana;Horrible. It is not intuitive at all. The system to increase times from notifications does not ask you for any compliance. Is a gotcha. Do not use this service it is a hoax.;1;2021-07-02;15.23.0
4013;SIMO M. LAFSIHI;Terrible application, it lacks a lot and the by bag that it gives with the number of area. It could be a bit assimilated even a little to its predecessor ePark or El Parking. The map does not work well, and San Feliu de Llobregat always marks me regardless of where it is hahaha ... Disappointing.;1;2021-07-02;15.23.0

4015;Rafael Marquez;It has nothing easy, this type of application e. Park specifically, which is the one I used, they are used to facilitate that if I am doing business and the time passes, you can get a ticket again from the mobile, and this application to do that, you have to call by phone or know you by heart the parking area number, or to be next to the car, so frankly it seems useless to me, when I finish the balance that I have pending I will probably uninstall it.;1;2021-07-01;15.23.0
4016;David Alvarez Aguilar;Good experience asking twice for registration, direct charge x card. An improvement that it does NOT have and I consider very important is that it warns you if the street where you are going to park, for example in Madrid, is the border of two different areas. Epark had such functionality.;4;2021-06-30;15.22.0
4017;Juan Fernández;The application is so "easy" that it dispenses with the purchase confirmation or the introduction of a password to accept an expense. A single accidental click and you have already made a payment, without being able to cancel or modify it. Since the app designers have deliberately made it this way, it seems like a joke to me. Uninstalled. EasyPark's response is not worth me, what I claim - a purchase confirmation before an irreversible step - is not the responsibility of the municipalities.;1;2021-06-30;15.0
4018;Alberto Pol Mate;Bad performance, constant drops, account scam company surcharge of 6 euros, 18cent surcharge every time you put time, minimum parking without the possibility of canceling time and you get money back. I clarify, for the cost they charge to have a business account to be profitable, you have to do a lot of payment services. 😜;1;2021-06-29;15.23.0

4031;Miguel A. Cañadas Mercado;Terrible and thief app. At the moment they are holding me hostage for the balance that I had in ePark, since they neither return it to me nor allow me to consume it in the conditions that I had in ePark when I recharged.

Or maybe uninstall it before, since it is preferable to give a few euros to have something to do with rabble like this.;1;2021-06-23;15.22.0
4032;Tomás Morales;Forced to switch from the epark app to this one without any options. Now I am going to pay for parking plus the cost of easypark, which I did not have before. It seems like a scam to me;1;2021-06-22;15.22.0
4033;Sara;I just migrated my e-park account (since I had no other option) I find it embarrassing that with the good application that e-park was, in this new one commissions are charged (yes, I know that it is to maintain the app and blah blah blah) and be so convoluted. E-park was very easy and intuitive. They should give us the option to refund e-park balance. Without a doubt, as soon as the balance is exhausted, I return to the use of coins. I will inform myself to see if it is legal that they do not give us a return option.;1;2021-06-21;15.22.0

4040;Francisco Javier Gonzalez Rojas;I have tried the application again and it seems that now it works correctly, (for now), the only downside is that (according to the person in charge of easypark), you cannot stop the parking when you finish, you have to suck the time you put in, although already Do not be parked, because that is a matter of the Lorca city council, according to it only happens in Madrid and Lorca. Otherwise well. Although it is shameful that they charge you for parking on the street.;3;2021-06-16;15.22.0

4045;Francisco Carbonell;The app is a scam. They charge e-park, an application without commissions, they force you to install this and they pass you all the outstanding balance instead of returning it. They tell you that they give you 3 operations without commissions, but there are only two. They charge you an abusive minimum commissions, being many times more expensive than the ticket. And they tell you that they charge you because they give you more options, such as expanding the ticket, but if you want to expand it, they will charge you the minimum commission again.

And being the maximum parking period two hours they give you a margin of one hour to eliminate the penalty, That is to say, I pay 2 hours, or so I think, I don't worry and fine with no margin for correction, don't use it, don't risk piling up fines.;1;2021-06-10;15.22.0

I edit my review: It is a lie there are other companies like Blinkay that the service is still free, it has been like that for more than a year, inform yourself a little;1;2021-05-17;15.15.1
4119;Carmen Roldán;I am outraged! They fined me this afternoon because of this application, they gave me another area and even having paid they gave me a 60 euro fine. I do not recommend it at all, zero intuitive, it works fatal. And on top of that it causes you to be fined, it's a shame !! For me it is a zero;1;2021-05-14;15.21.0
4120;Juan Luis S R;A theft, once the epark account was migrated, the average of each parking lot has cost me 3 times more than before. Conclusion, uninstalled and searched for another app;1;2021-05-14;15.20.0

4124;Mm;I just realized that you charge commission, and goodbye App, I put the coin back in the parking meter, with how happy I was with the previous one, you made me change but you do not say what you are going to charge. I noticed that I paid more than before but it is amazing. Swindle.;1;2021-05-13;15.20.0
4125;Yprincesa Albakua;I have been a controller and I have the application for years, sometimes it fails because of the server but I am happy;5;2021-05-13;15.20.0
4126;David Mi Negocio Visible;Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. You cannot trust that you can use it.;1;2021-05-12;15.20.0
4127;Juan Reiner;It works fatal, it does not give more than failures. It turns out that you can cancel the ticket without even a confirmation button, that is to say that with a touch on the screen you are canceled ... and of course ... they fine you and they wash their hands. On top of that, you have to let them access your GPS. I no longer plan to use the application. They end up fining you the same and you have to pay exorbitant commissions ... In short, a scam.;1;2021-05-12;15.18.0
4128;María de los Santos;My assessment includes the payment of the parking, with which I am happy, but if they give me a fine for excessive time, they do not tell me, I do not like that at all;2;2021-05-12;15.20.0
4129;Maria Lahoz;I was very happy with the app but I have noticed that the "stop parking" button is misleading. Today I have used it for the first time, I have put an hour of parking and the counter has started. They just called me, I had to go and I stopped, which was my surprise when he charged me for the entire hour and eliminated the ticket. Two eurazos given to the city council and an idiot face. What is the "stop" button for then ????, why does it delete the ticket ?????;2;2021-05-11;15.19.0
4130;ana minuzzi;It does not give the option to erase the card data or load the data to just pay for a parking (which is what I needed and where I live this is not used and I only use it 1 time on vacation) It also does not work as appropriate, it gave me an error when select the parking lot and I end up creating 2 overlays for the same car (9:30 a.m. to 10 a.m. and 9:30 a.m. to 10:30 a.m.), but since he never gave me proof, I had to run to the parking meter to pay, so I ended up paying 3 times for the same parking! Terrible app !!;1;2021-05-11;15.20.0
4131;MIsQuiMe;I like that they charge you for time really parked;5;2021-05-11;15.20.0

4133;Paola Licon;Practical .. very easy to use;5;2021-05-10;15.20.0
4134;Antonio Peregrina;A disaster. There are already two fines in a month that I have the application. Canceling them is a hassle. Wild commission compared to other apps. By default it leaves the old locations recorded. It does not allow to recharge. Useless information about the SER zone of Madrid. They have managed to put back the manual tickets because I do not trust a hair of this amateur application;1;2021-05-10;15.20.0
4135;Javier Manuel Fernánez Munera;Fatal. I have it for not losing the balance of e-park, that last one was easy, simple, for the whole family ... And free .....;1;2021-05-10;15.20.0
4136;Juan José Rubio;And the balance I had in e-park, how do I get it back?;2;2021-05-08;15.20.0
4137;Isidro R.;All the time a message appears that says: The current price cannot be recovered;1;2021-05-07;15.20.0
4138;Yadhira Soilan;I am unable to use it. He always tells me that he can't find the area. The application I used before did not give me these problems. I have not been able to use it yet;1;2021-05-07;15.20.0
4139;E. Teresa Farías Grau;Excellent, practical !!;5;2021-05-05;15.20.0
4140;Moha Meddah;Expensive and indistinguishable a car with an ECO label;1;2021-05-05;15.20.0
4141;Isaac Pascual;Unfortunately I had to go from ePark which was magnificent and they did not charge commission to EasyPark which for the moment works well for me, but the commission is very high. When the balance runs out I will study whether to change to another with less commission.;3;2021-05-04;15.20.0
4142;Eduardo Sánchez Ruiz;Once the payment has been resolved, the charge has indeed been 0. Thank you for your response.;4;2021-05-03;15.20.0
4143;Isaac Tejada;I correct my review, excuse me, the error comes that it does not automatically jump from the end time to the next start time, it would be fine, so as not to have to spend 12h turning the wheel, it would also be good that once you have arrived at the payment limit (example 1.70), it will not let you continue spending hours, so as not to lead you to believe that you have more time. Again sorry for the previous comment;3;2021-05-03;15.20.0
4144;lara veira;Terrible, do not trust if you look at the penalties because even if they tell you that there is no maybe yes and they advise you to go to the parking meter to check ... for this, it is better to remove the option from the app if it is of no use !!! Even above they have a record that if you have looked at the sanctions and that you have a ticket prior to the expiration of the sanction, but they are not responsible ... of course the sanctioning company also washes its hands!;1;2021-05-03;15.20.0
4145;Fernando Jiménez Domínguez;When changing from epark to easyPark the 30 cts went to 48cts 30 minutes. I prefer not to use the application;1;2021-05-03;15.20.0
4146;Pablo Scalcione;This application is chaos, charges arrive at the bank the next day you pay to park and so it is very difficult to know that they are not scamming you. For those of us who spend the day from place to place to park it is not worth it. It seems incredible with how well the other worked, we have to be forced to use this one.;1;2021-04-30;15.20.0
4147;Ana Maria Larrosa;The application is very useful and comfortable.;5;2021-04-30;15.20.0
4148;Tirso Fernandez Valles;It works well;4;2021-04-29;15.19.0
4149;José María Buendía Pérez;The evolution from e-park has meant an increase in the collection of commissions and a decline in functionality, complaints can no longer be canceled from the application. As soon as I spend the remaining balance I uninstall. ----------- There is no option for the develop response, not only does it not warn you, but you have to look for them in a redirect to a web external to the application that simply does not work. This "non-functionality" is in the PAYMENTS AND SANCTIONS section, and not in the help section. I reiterate my score and my previous comment.;2;2021-04-29;15.19.0
4150;Javier R;You mark parking, then it takes off by itself and you find the complaint on the glass;1;2021-04-28;15.20.0
4151;Alberto Molina;It does not let the parking meter stop if you make a wrong registration;1;2021-04-27;15.20.0
4152;Ramón Mares Bufi;Okay, but I think it would be quite complete, if when you left with the car, and you have not remembered for the app's parking meter, you could configure the app, so that it would stop the parking meter or parking, whatever you want to call it . Because many are sure that it has happened more than once, that you leave without remembering to stop the parking lot.;4;2021-04-26;15.20.0
4153;David Fonseca;After the closing of E-park, an excellent application without commissions the balance was passed to this company. Well, to my surprise they not only charge commissions, but they are the highest commissions in the entire market. The minimum rate in Madrid green zone is 15 cents. Well, these guys give you 18 cents of minimum commission, making a total of 33 cents. Other applications I paid only 17 cents. I am clear that as soon as the balance is finished, if I do not change your abusive policy, I will use others.;1;2021-04-26;15.19.0

4157;Andres Romero;I will never use it, it says that you save time and money and it is a lie, for an hour in green parking in Madrid they charge me 25 cents more than in the street meter;1;2021-04-22;15.19.0
4158;Felipe Solís;Fatal change from e park that worked great to this crap;1;2021-04-21;15.19.0
4159;Jose Ramon Velarde Rabasa;It doesn't have a wallet, so I have to link the application with a card or create a PayPal account and I don't want to. That's not counting the 10% commissions. They take time to confirm, ... I have no problems, I uninstall it and go back to the coins.;1;2021-04-21;15.19.0
4160;Angel Herrera;Increase the parking time without having requested it;1;2021-04-20;15.18.0
4161;Gabi Galvez;They forced us to go from e-park to this one without warning that they charge 10% for service;1;2021-04-19;15.19.0
4162;Jorge Gallego Galván;They charge an additional 10% of the cost. Because of this application I have been fined € 90. I put the ticket and it works. Minutes later, the application sends me a notification that my parking ticket has not been registered (I don't see it until 15-20 min later). When I get to the car I have the ticket. Customer service alleges that they sent me notifications that the parking lot has not been registered and with that they wash their hands. Conclusion, they force you to be looking at your phone all the time.;1;2021-04-19;15.19.0
4163;Ricardo Pérez Campos;Very comfortable and easy to handle, but it is absurd that they do not allow you to put two tickets at the same time. In addition, it does not warn well when the ticket is about to end;2;2021-04-17;15.19.0
4164;M CARMEN Andrades;I do not like it. It also charges a commission. I can't go back to Epark. I don't think I will continue to use it;1;2021-04-16;15.19.0
4165;Lucas Daniel Pertuzatti;It does not allow me to pay a fine, the deadline is going to pass and due to the failure of the app I will have to pay 4 times more than I should !!! I've been using it for months and it won't let you cancel the fine, ALWAYS BUT ALWAYS GIVES AN ERROR, DO NOT TRUST THIS APP;1;2021-04-15;15.19.0
4166;Павел Тихоненко;Be careful with the application ... It is a robbery ... I would not mind paying for its service, but you get double the payment ... If you pay half an hour for parking, its cost has to be 35 cnt in my city, Well, these charge 58, like this, for the face ...;1;2021-04-15;15.19.0
4167;Siro Morales;Good application and comfortable;5;2021-04-15;15.19.0
4168;Rafael Moreno;It won't let you stop the parking lot. If you leave before, they charge you the same. What a shame;1;2021-04-14;15.16.0_rc2

4170;Jose Luis M.T.;They change you from Epark to this app that charges you commission for each ticket. see you never;1;2021-04-14;15.19.0
4171;juan manuel almeida garrido;Easy Park charged me one euro at 4:30 a.m. with the car in the garage, without having active tickets and without information, I hope the refund is made and that it is a mistake and not a common practice;5;2021-04-14;15.19.0
4172;Khaled Q.F;Disastrous, unintuitive, functionally a disaster. The change from epark to this is a nonsense, as soon as the balance ends I do not use it anymore.;1;2021-04-13;15.19.0
4173;Fátima Aguado Badillo;They charge you very high rates, it is very expensive.;1;2021-04-13;15.19.0
4174;Andrea RM;Terrible! They charge a commission for using it, as if we didn't pay enough to park on the street. In addition, setting the location is absurd and uncomfortable, sometimes it does not take it well and you have to look for the name of the street, and if you want to renew a ticket without being in the car you have to look at the map or remember the street. Very uncomfortable and not very intuitive. And on top of it a scam!;1;2021-04-13;15.15.1
4175;Cristobal Vázquez;Necessary and better .... The previous one. Viewing the penalties is now more complicated than in epark. It's like you go out of the app.;3;2021-04-12;15.18.0
4176;Jose Luis Gonzalez Fernandez;It would be interesting to add the location of handicap parking;5;2021-04-12;15.19.0
4177;Guillermo Perez del Pulgar Frowein;The new version is poorly made on purpose. - It does not notify you if you are trying to book over the allowed period, it simply charges you up to the maximum. - Long incomprehensible texts to confirm stupidities - Alpha application interface when the previous one was good Almost beats the update of the sworn one. I uninstall it as soon as I find a better one.;1;2021-04-12;15.19.0
4178;Rocio Garrido;Hello I am trying to use the application and I can not. It tells me that it is installed but it does not let me use it;3;2021-04-11;15.19.0
4179;Dj Aly;Fatal do not install it if you come from epark, at no time when you change the account does it tell you that this application charges a commission. In the application page it does not put it either and I have reviewed it a few times before making the application change that I can assure you. I immediately delete it.;1;2021-04-10;15.19.0
4180;Angel L.M;Much better the previous e-park.;3;2021-04-10;15.17.1
4181;Pablo Gonzalez;I just "migrated" from e-park and it won't let me open the application despite having received 8 verification codes on my mobile ... Thanks for the reply, the application now works correctly.;3;2021-04-10;15.19.0
4182;Carlos Córcoles;In the end you are forced to look from E-park, which has no commission, to this App, which does (and no less than 10%). Anyway, today I have given the first use with the card and I find that for a charge of € 1, in the end I end up paying € 1.18 in total. Anyway, I will return to the coins, because I am not willing to pay this "extra tax";1;2021-04-09;15.19.0
4183;Pablo Natal;I had to replace it with ePark, which worked perfect. Now if you have a fine eg. There is no way of knowing. I do not like it. The change has been for the worse;1;2021-04-09;15.19.0
4184;fernando m LaGo;Go shit !!! Go enlightened. If you charge commissions for an app, that works at least degenerate.;1;2021-04-09;15.19.0

4186;José Rubio;I have been able to pass an e-park account. Now we need to test the app and see how it is.;3;2021-04-08;15.19.0
4187;Lorenzo Boni;Very bad, it allows you to choose a wrong time and then it charges you and adjusts the time, and you can no longer undo it. It also charges an abusive percentage, the last time it was 18 cents out of 10 for parking (that is, 180% of the parking fee). Very bad;1;2021-04-08;15.19.0
4188;Estefania Timiraos;It goes fatal.;1;2021-04-08;15.19.0
4189;Miryam Prieto;The application is fatal. I've been trying for half an hour to go from epark to this one and there's no way it's going to work. As it goes so bad to park on the street I don't even want to imagine it ... Disappointing;1;2021-04-08;15.19.0
4190;Angel martinez bello;It works awful, and they charge you commission. Epark worked much better, this application is useless;1;2021-04-08;15.19.0
4191;Alejandro García-Atance;Dear programmers of this application: Apart from liars (they say it takes less than a minute to configure, I have been 10 and it still gives me problems) they are rubbish as programmers. Your application is not capable of reading the codes that you send me.;1;2021-04-08;15.19.0
4192;L. B. BP;It does not work. I want to deposit money, ask for a code, I put it, it says invalid and that it is not my phone number !!! ??? In loop. I WANT e- PARK AGAIN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!;1;2021-04-08;15.19.0
4193;Andrea Fernández;I'm trying to activate the new application, the SMS arrives and it won't let me continue even putting the code ... The truth leaves a lot to be desired, the other one was a thousand times better.;1;2021-04-08;15.19.0
4194;Sergio Perez;You force me to change from an application that works well epark to this one that does not even allow me to enter the sms code that you send me that the number is incorrect;1;2021-04-08;15.19.0
4195;Marina García de Mateos;I just had to migrate from e-park and it works awful. I don't know how to finish opening the app despite putting the password, my balance has no idea. The other app did not work much better and I do not understand why I had to change forced;1;2021-04-08;15.19.0
4196;Rafael;Bad, I can't complete the registration because it doesn't recognize the code that they send me to my mobile and the app gets toasted ... I start the migration well;1;2021-04-08;15.19.0
4197;Ángel González;I cannot migrate my e-park account. When doing the migration from the application, I request the code that arrives by SMS but after several attempts, it always gives me a failed code that validates the phone number, but this is correct because the SMS is reaching me. Can you review it and tell me something, please? Thanks.;2;2021-04-08;15.19.0
4198;Jose Antonio Gallo;They take me out of e-park with a balance of more than 20 e and this App does not install me .... Bad, I feel docked right now.;1;2021-04-08;15.19.0
4199;Pilar Flor;Unable to enter the app. The browser recognizes my number and email, but I can't access it through the app.;1;2021-04-08;15.19.0

4201;claudia Vaz Torralba;It took 10 attempts to put the 4-digit code that they sent me by SMS and it says it is not valid. I am forced to migrate to this application so as not to lose the balance that I had in epark and in this new one they charge me commission. A real shame. I do not understand why the change forced to something worse.;1;2021-04-08;15.19.0
4202;EduR G.C.;I have downloaded the new application and it gives me an error all the time when entering the code that they send x sms. I demand that it be solved since e-parck I have money that I cannot use;1;2021-04-08;15.19.0
4203;David Peña;Application with numerous bugs (errors). When an error screen appears, not even the reason appears, only the error code -1. Better not use it since after 10 minutes of frustration at the end you have to approach the parking meter on duty. This app only serves to occupy space on your mobile;1;2021-04-08;15.19.0
4204;Guillermo Díaz Gil;A FRAUD!!! I have not even been able to enter the application and I can no longer use the previous one ... it is a scam, they send me SMS with codes that are not valid, and they tell me that my phone number is incorrect ... Very happy with the previous application after years of use ... and now this is A SCAM;1;2021-04-08;15.19.0
4205;M.J P.S.;With Epark we never had any problems. Now we can not even register in this. It does not accept the codes sent by the application and it is impossible. Thanks for leaving us without a parking app. What a fabric.;1;2021-04-08;15.19.0
4206;isabel lopez;It does not allow the account to be activated, it constantly states that the code they send is incorrect;1;2021-04-08;15.19.0
4207;Nuria;The mask. Too much commission. Any other app is better.;1;2021-04-08;15.18.0
4208;Gisela Miró Villa;A scam !!! They sell you something that is not, because even if you pay there they keep your money and they give you the same fine. Wash your hands. They are without shame!;1;2021-04-06;15.18.0
4209;Jorge Toyos Argüelles;For 6 min in the green zone he has charged me € 0.38. When the parking meter is not even € 0.15. Very disappointed;1;2021-04-06;15.18.0
4210;Helena Carrasco;Nefarious experience. Since I switched, it's a lousy app. Not very intuitive, I put the card for the payment and they inactivate it, why? Because they feel like it, I try to insert another card and nothing ... what happened? Well, I had to go to the machine. Instead of making it easy, it is nefarious. I call customer service and they pass the note, I'll go to the parking lot. I liked e-park better, it never gave a problem.;1;2021-04-05;15.18.0
4211;Manuel Atiénzar Lara;I park at 11pm: at night with an inactive blue zone, and the absurdity begins: in the application, only the two hours immediately afterwards can be selected for payment, that is, from 11pm to 1am, hours in which there is no need to pay for parking . The APP does not allow you to select the first two hours of payment the next morning, that is, from 9 to 11. Am I supposed to set an alarm at 9 to then make the payment for the blue zone? Y No. You cannot set the end time at 11. Maximum 2 hours;1;2021-04-05;15.18.0
4212;David Martin;And as if that were not enough, complaints cannot be annulled either. I hope my balance runs out and I delete. A pity that e-park stopped working.;1;2021-04-05;15.18.0
4213;Montserrat se;Very bad I come from epark and they charge commission, which they do not notice, it seems fatal to me. I will use up the balance and unsubscribe. I feel cheated. ”It is not good for parking in Alcalá de Henares. DO NOT SWITCH TO THIS APPLICATION.;1;2021-04-03;15.19.0
4214;Iris Rua;I find it very impractical when it comes to expanding the ticket / making a new one since I have to find the exact location of the car on the map again, when in E-park it was simply to press a button and that's it. Honestly not intuitive.;2;2021-04-03;15.19.0
4215;Guillermo de la Calzada;Very expensive, with the application that was used before in Coruña you paid the same as in the machine with this app it is much more expensive in the machine 30 cents 30 min with the app 15 min 48 cents😱;1;2021-04-03;15.18.0
4216;Javier blanco delso;BEWARE of new users or E-PARK users, THEY CHARGE COMMISSIONS OF 10% WITH A MINIMUM OF 15 cent COMMISSION, it seems slow to me that they make you change without telling you the commission that they are going to charge you and that they make you dependent on an application for then give you the dunk !! I am going to uninstall it and I am going to advise against it to everyone !! I give it a star because I can't give it 0 ...;1;2021-04-02;15.14.1

4220;Luis F. Pérez;Today I had to go to Alcobendas and the parking meter could not be paid in this application, it said I could not find the area, thank goodness I had a machine next to it to pay in cash;1;2021-03-29;15.18.0
4221;Florentino Borondo;From the beginning it worked badly for me. impossible to be sure if the transaction has been made. Today it was not done, due to lack of funds of which he did not notify me, and you give a fine to singing. € 90 the joke. I uninstall it;1;2021-03-29;15.18.0
4222;Perraloka Loka;I preferred E-park since they don't charge anything to use it and now they force you to use this app. They are thieves because the commissions are super high when those who should pay the app would be the municipalities that are linked to it and not the users since the City Council profits from this. In short, they are Thieves politicians and businessmen who get rich at the expense of the people. I hope it goes bad for you and you have to close. THIEVES !!!!;1;2021-03-28;15.18.0
4223;Carlota Ferrer;Incredible the malfunction of the application in Madrid. It is not capable of recognizing the different neighborhoods when they are close to each other, and it only gives you a single option to select, without warning you that you are in an area that is confluent with other areas as in the previous APP. RESULT: City Council fine for paying a ticket in the wrong area.;1;2021-03-28;15.18.0
4224;Diego Martinez;It is an abuse. For 10 minutes, almost 50 cents and they don't tell you the cost. Thieves;1;2021-03-27;15.18.0
4225;Miguel Ayanz;Much worse than the previous app. Complex interface. It does not allow to put tickets with completion in following days. Complex recharge. Fatal.;1;2021-03-27;15.18.0
4226;María Loureiro Hernández;The app would seem useful to me if it worked correctly, but it is not. For me, the biggest advantage of this application is the possibility of extending the initial parking time and it has not worked for me any of the times I have tried. He always tells me that it has not been possible to do it and to try again later. And not later or another day. In addition, when pressing "stop parking" there is no double confirmation, so if you give it by mistake there is no other option than to pay for a new parking lot.;1;2021-03-26;15.18.0
4227;ana ferreiro;I don't like the app. It has a VERY BIG defect if by chance you forgot to pay or renew the cricket from the app they offer you the possibility of consulting the fines but ATTENTION due to a failure of the same (€ 120 was supposed to me) and that they do not assume, the Those responsible tell you that YOU HAVE NO CANCELABLE SANCTIONS you trust yourself and do not cancel the fine (€ 6 during the 1st hour) and if you go to the car you will find a € 60 sanction. AN AUTHENTIC SCAM !!!! INJUSTICE !!!;1;2021-03-26;15.18.0
4228;Ramón Aldao;Too bad, when trying to extend time without reaching the limit, it gives an error and does not allow it to be changed, on several occasions it does not indicate the cost until you have already paid it. The previous application worked perfect and much more intuitive.;1;2021-03-26;15.18.0
4229;Pablo Perea;I think I am at a loss for words to express how little I recommend this app. From epark to easypark is one of the worst app changes I've ever seen.;1;2021-03-26;15.18.0
4230;Silvia Gómez Ayuso;It is the worst application I have seen ... Definitely the change is for the worse. He sets the time he wants and when he feels like it, for the location of the area it is terrible. A shame;1;2021-03-26;15.18.0
4231;Javi Valero;The change from the previous application has been for the worse. This app does not warn you of the maximum parking limits until you have activated the ticket adjusting the time on your own. You should warn of the limit before activating the ticket. In addition, when you want to park until the last hour of the day, you have to manually set the time with minute 59. In the previous app, the ticket would pass you until the next day. Which was more comfortable.;2;2021-03-25;15.18.0
4232;JOSE OVIDIO Garcia;How is it possible that having € 1.64 of balance and the cost of parking € 0.93 tells me that I do not have enough balance and that I have to add a credit card and it does not let me start at parking time?;1;2021-03-24;15.18.0
4233;Juan Manuel Hernández Castro;Terrible application. Poor interface, transfer of deleted data from e-park without knowledge and consent, and in the first parking lot a fine after paying the ticket with the application by mistake. First and last time I use it. Nothing recommendable.;1;2021-03-24;15.18.0
4234;isabel marta vazquez;I would like to know if you can pay for the parking of two cars at the same time. With e-park it was perfectly possible and now I don't see the way. It is also much more cumbersome to use and on top of that they charge ... A change for the worse.;1;2021-03-24;15.18.0
4235;Agueda Alvarado;I have been trying to pay with several different bank cards for 3 days and it turns out that every time I enter the card data it appears to me as inactive, when they are cards that I use daily without any problem, this is really disastrous. Who is going to pay the fines generated by this failure? You don't, then please solution SOLUTION !!;1;2021-03-24;15.18.0
4236;Carlos Magraner Ubieta;Malfunction and they charge you an extra for each ticket you get. Claimed refund of balance, as soon as they pay me I remove it. I clearly do not recommend it.;1;2021-03-24;15.18.0

4240;Marta muñoz aranda;Terrible application. It charges you high management fees (more than 30%). Nothing recommendable. Epark was much better.;1;2021-03-23;15.17.1
4241;isabel baldomero;I put the holiday schedule by mistake and the application let me do it and I paid unnecessarily .. What is the use of knowing where you are and then not letting you know !! I called by phone and they clarified it very well and with a fantastic treatment.;5;2021-03-23;15.18.0

4246;A. Pereira;Lousy I loved e-park, the change has been for the worse and I'm only using it because I still have a balance. I do not find it "user friendly" and I have also felt ripped off. I had a valid ticket but when I tried to extend the parking time, it was impossible (it gave me error after error) and after several unsuccessful attempts I had to create a new ticket. To my surprise, when I saw the details, I paid more in application fees (€ 0.18) than for the parking itself (€ 0.20). GOODBYE EasyP;1;2021-03-22;15.18.0
4247;RUBEN;It does not take coverage or putting the name of the street having gps activated ... Impossible to use it;1;2021-03-20;15.18.0
4248;espadas7;By making the obligatory change from e-park, I did not keep the money that I had in my account, when I went to pay for the same parking, in the same time slot and during the same time it was more than 30% more expensive and when requesting I was asked for the reasons for the drop in hours to see if it could be solved and by maintaining the decision, days have passed and I have no news or have been terminated.;1;2021-03-19;15.17.1
4249;Fernando Garcia;The change from epark to this new application leaves much to be desired. Less intuitive, functional, impractical and more expensive ... They should rethink going back to the previous application.;1;2021-03-19;15.16.0_rc2
4250;Pilar G.A.;Having to locate where you park your car on the map is a horror, before it was more comfortable with e-Park. And what is worse, it forces you to have an active card to make payments, when it is advisable to have remote or online payments deactivated. Customer security 0. You could consider changing it ...;1;2021-03-19;15.17.1
4251;Estela Del Moral;Fatal that with the migration of the previous EPARK parking app that it had to this one (by imposition) it has stopped having the option that the balance recharge is applied to the phone bill;1;2021-03-18;15.14.1
4252;Mayca Ezcurra;I do not think it is very ethical that customers change our app to Easypark WITHOUT the option to refund the amount. I don't want to pay you commissions and by the nose that EPark has not given me the option of not having anything with you. If I chose EPark it was for convenience and of course, without commissions and I just read that you charge even for notifying. _____ I leave my previous comment I modify *, because I have not used it yet, but I have my balance of € 9. I stay because Andres has been convincing and I will try;3;2021-03-18;15.18.0
4253;Lidia Barcia;When I went through the application, I said that they kept the balance that I had in e-park, which was 4 with something, and when I use it on Saturday, 4 hours in total, I see that they have charged me from my card 2.63 when I had 4 euros left in the old app. Where is my previous balance? They will have to return it to me or not to charge me, I say!;1;2021-03-18;15.18.0
4254;Pepa Lt;It's unfortunate that I had to change from e_ park, I don't know why they changed it if the other one worked better, as soon as my balance runs out, I'll look for another application that is more comfortable for me.

4265;Ana Lapaz;Horrible, this app is terrible, I wish the old one would return, more intuitive and easy to use, I really don't understand why apps that work really well change. Completely disappointed, apps are supposed to make your life easier and not complicate your life even more. Also, since there is no option to confirm parking time, sometimes it puts the time you did not want and you have to pay even more, a disaster;1;2021-03-16;15.15.1

4269;cjSam cjSam;Unfortunately I have read the comments after they forced me to migrate from epark in order not to lose the balance I had. It is not free, and unlike epark it is not very intuitive to use. Update: It is a bit scam, they charge commission on the base value instead of on what is actually paid for the parking meter, a ticket of € 1 and commission € 0.21, and the minimum commission € 0.18 although I only parked 10 mins. With what I have used, I am paying a commission between 30 and 40% of the real cost of the parking meter !!;1;2021-03-14;15.17.1

4271;Natalia Bielza Lino;With easypark it is more expensive than doing it directly in the street. Before with epark it did not happen. How is it possible?. I was forced to change because they sent me an email telling me that epark stopped working. It does not work well for me, there is no way to recharge money and having a balance for the street guards does not work out that you have paid parking. Is there a way to return to epark? It is a hoax.;1;2021-03-14;15.15.1
4272;Edu S.;Not bad ... Worse. The payment system, after the App locates you with gps. It gives example errors (I park in La Coruña, at 06:00 in the morning and when I have to make the first payment at 10:00, my phone and I are in Santiago. I look for where I have it parked on the map. Mess and fine "It was easier before, you indicated the area, if it was blue, red or orange. No need to activate GPS, or search on maps or put directions or other issues. It was fast and effective.

4276;Alex Ph;I used the e-park app and they kept insisting that I switch to it with almost daily notifications. What if it was better compatible with more cities.

4286;Ricardo López de la Fuente;After using e-park now the mandatory transfer to Easy-Park is not satisfactory. The service charge, which in the previous application did not exist, is wrong. The worst thing is that every time you extend your time, you have to pay a new amount of 0.18 Euros. It is not a good practice. I think no one is happy with the change;1;2021-03-08;15.17.1

4288;Anto;I was an epark user that worked perfectly and they forced me to change to this one that charges you every time you expand.

When I changed e-park no one informed me that 18 cent was going to be stolen from me. for every 30 I pay. I feel cheated and on top of that, I cancel the tickets at the minute, which translates into a fine of € 60. Fatal, a real OWL. P.S. It takes 1 star because you cannot put 0.;1;2021-03-04;15.17.1

4306;H P;Today I used it for the first time after E-park and apparently it did not log in properly and I had supposedly paid my parking meter ticket, but when I return, I see that I have been fined. When I go to the sanctions section, I do not find that I have any and now I do not have proof that I thought I had paid, since now it has started well and it no longer appears in the history and in PayPal, the payment does not appear.

4315;Mario Dominguez;The consultation / cancellation of sanctions systematically fails ... They allege that being an external server they do not have control over the cancellation of sanctions and thus clean their hands, and despite the complaints they do not fix the "error". Another separate issue is that they have removed the option for the user to deliver or "fish" a ticket with valid time remaining, I do not approve of the fact that they remove that option from me in the app when it is regularly done between users on the street. This app should be improved without a doubt;1;2021-02-26;15.17

4319;Juan JJ;From "easy" it has the name, that they put me a world map to park it seems to me that they are laughing at one .... I edit ... and a virtual wheel too. Disaster;1;2021-02-25;15.17
4320;JOSE L HERNANDEZ;Terrible application !!!! I do not recommend it !!! It is very tricky. They fined me because the application wrongly located me more than a kilometer from where my car was actually parked, without notifying me, and on top of that they charged me € 0.18, when the cost of parking was € 0.75. Come on, the joke has cost me € 30;1;2021-02-25;15.17
4321;Toni Alonso;eye, check the commission they charge. It is easy to use, but it does not easily inform you of the account movements, you have to enter the tickets one by one to see how much it has cost you;3;2021-02-25;15.17
4322;Roque Lois;It came from e-park, with credit in this application, and they force me to pass this monster, also charging me without warning. Gentlemen, please respect my money. How do I access the basic rate? Parking is already expensive enough to steal 10% more with this crap application. Answers!!!;1;2021-02-24;15.16.0_rc2
4323;Mercedes Sánchez;Easypark is a real disaster. E-park worked great, it was super intuitive and right off the bat they change you to Easypark that you don't understand anything. As soon as my balance drops to zero, I look for another app.;1;2021-02-24;15.17
4324;Un usuario de Google;It's generally fine, but I don't like being charged commissions. With the previous app that they forced me to port, I had no fees for recharging the wallet. When they start charging me, I uninstall it and pay for parking by the parking meter;2;2021-02-24;15.17
4325;Jose Sempere;Simple to use and very practical;5;2021-02-24;15.17
4326;Agustín Rodríguez;It's easy, intuitive, and works well;4;2021-02-24;15.17
4327;Pedro BM;Impossible to cancel penalties of 4 euros they become 30 ... they say that they connect to an external server ... that in epark it never fails for years and in its EasyPark it always fails ...;1;2021-02-23;15.17
4328;David Ruperez;They are thiefs. Formerly I had E-PARK in which they did not charge you commission and without warning they forced me to download the Easypark app. In which they charge you a commission for each time you park. So angry. Waiting to run out of balance and say goodbye.;1;2021-02-23;15.16.0_rc2
4329;Lucía Jiménez;After using epark, seeing that this has absorbed it, it charges you a commission and also gives more problems than the other, it is clear to me that here it is always more important to make a profit, than the satisfaction of the users. This is a clear example: an app like epark, which worked great, and they have to load it to get a slice, they don't care about the rest. I erase myself.;1;2021-02-23;15.16.0_rc2
4330;Dore Amaya;I have a charge in my account of the application of 1.20. I go to the Application and there is NO ticket with that amount or with that date. After 4 uses I uninstalled it because the prices seem excessive to me and At the end one day in a hurry I had to reinstall it and bang 1.20 WITHOUT having gotten the ticket. I charge in account and in the application neither an invoice nor a notification, NOTHING that tells you that they have charged you that or why. If I don't look at the account, they charge it and I don't even realize it. ALREADY LOOK AT IT. I DO NOT RECOMMEND.;1;2021-02-23;15.16.0_rc2
4331;Alberto Fernández;The 10% commission seems abusive to me, something like 1% would seem reasonable to me. I'm going to try another app that says it's free and if it's not true I'll use the parking meters again.;2;2021-02-22;15.16.0_rc2
4332;Luisa de Pablo;A disaster. The worst application I have seen in my life, I have not been able to use it even to pay for an ORA parkmeter. Epark was very good.;1;2021-02-22;15.16.0_rc2
4333;JOSE MANUEL ABASCAL;Terrible interface. Skip a notification and if you give it to delete it, it automatically increases parking by 30 minutes without requesting confirmation.;1;2021-02-22;15.16.0_rc2
4334;Pablo Jiménez Rellán;A garbage, easy to get confused when it comes to putting more or less time, nothing intuitive, it does not give you the real parking times, and on top of that now they charge an extra for the service of the app. A disappointment, it was much better and epark worked better.;1;2021-02-21;15.16.0_rc2
4335;Fernando Gutiérrez;Super comfortable, I avoid looking for the "totem" that is never close and return to the car to put the receipt;5;2021-02-21;15.17
4336;Juanjo Castro Ríos;It is precise when locating the car in its area, it warns in time to extend the parking time, so, if we do not know how long we are going to be, we can go in small sections until completing the maximum time allowed. This saves a lot and you don't waste parking time. All without going out every time. There are other applications, I keep this one.;5;2021-02-21;15.16.0_rc2
4337;Ta Blet;Regrettable. They charge commission. It does not allow you to indicate the parking area manually, you have to activate location. If you put the ticket when the regulated schedule has not started, you have to go round and round the wheel until it reaches the starting time. If they had started from scratch it would be understandable, but the sad thing is that ePark had all this. As soon as I spend the balance I had in ePark, I will go to the competition that in Santander does not charge a commission.;1;2021-02-21;15.10
4338;pau pien;epark worked wonderfully. Now with easypark they charge me 18 cents for each car park and also, I cannot pay for two vehicles at the same time, only one. Apparently, a girl who controlled the parking meter told me that there is an app that only works for Coruña, and that they don't charge a commission, but I don't know what it is. Also, it fails often and there is no evidence that I have paid and they give me a fine;2;2021-02-20;15.16.0_rc2
4339;Lucia Fernandez;Because I can't put a 0 ... I don't like this new app at all. I do not understand why change an (epark) that worked so well. In this new App you have to put where you are parked. Or use the location. Something I dont like. On the other hand, when you choose the time that you are going to be parked, in the previous one it would automatically pass you to the next fraction of payment. In this one, no, so you are going to pay for time that you should not pay. For example between 14:00 -16: 00h;1;2021-02-20;15.16.0_rc2
4340;grcgonzalo;This crap doesn't work. Luckily my partner runs TelPark and we were able to pay with his app. I am afraid I will never be able to get my 6 euros of balance back.;1;2021-02-19;15.16.0_rc2
4341;Flor Mño;Being happy with the previous application, E Park, one fine day it stops working and I have to download Easy Park in which they start to charge me commission. The surprise comes when I find out (because I called) that when making the change, Easy park applies the standard rate by default (includes commission) but if you enter their website, you can change the rate to basic (without commission), a boast transparency for the user. Finally, cancel complaints from the app, an impossible.;1;2021-02-19;15.16.0_rc2
4342;Elias Tabarez;Bad with greed, designed to trick you into overpaying. It does not allow to extend the tickets. Nor does it identify that you are already paying in an area and that the ticket is generated from the current completion. It does not allow you to cancel tickets in the future. You can not do worse, a shame, I will use the parking meters again. Besides, the profit percentage is abusive.;1;2021-02-19;15.16.0_rc2
4343;Roberto Martín Martín;Terrible app. I answer here, given the terrible organization you have, give me back what does not belong to you, I uninstall the APP and settled the matter. But since the € 15 of e-park I have not enjoyed, reimburse me. I have written to you by email, by Facebook and by calling and you have even deigned to check my charges, only to say that the transfer is automatic. So give me my money back and do well.;1;2021-02-19;15.16.0_rc2
4344;jhonny castro chavez;Very good 👌;5;2021-02-19;15.16.0_rc2
4345;Juan J. Rodríguez;Very good application, to improve the management of complaints. Thanks;5;2021-02-19;15.16.0_rc2
4346;Daniel Arroyo;Bad app .... More expensive and I can't find where to cancel a complaint .. Epark was much better for my taste ..;1;2021-02-19;15.16.0_rc2
4347;Maria Méndez;After 4 days of having it, I have been fined for locating me in another area "although the GPS has detected it well and you have been the one who has moved it." Apparently "a lot happens to them in Madrid." So I do not recommend anyone in Madrid to install it.;1;2021-02-19;15.16.0_rc2
4348;Tania Pedreira;In the market the need is the customer. It is possible to register several license plates but nevertheless two parking lots cannot be registered at the same time, I cannot register my mother's parking lots that I don't want to use the parking meter, and the app is not intuitive for the non-digital generation. I continue to use the app, because I need it for my vehicle as well and in these times of pandemic I refuse to touch a parking meter.;1;2021-02-19;15.16.0_rc2
4349;juan miguel Diez;Very bad. It won't let you pay, even if you have money. It also does not let you extend time;1;2021-02-18;15.16.0_rc2
4350;Borja Izuzquiza;The new app is more intuitive and easy to use;4;2021-02-18;15.16.0_rc2
4351;Anita Martín;Unfortunate, it unhinges anyone, with how good e-park was. They force you to change and there is no one to do anything with the new application.;1;2021-02-18;15.16.0_rc2
4352;Diego Tapia;Very sorry service. After years without any problems of use with e-Park, I am forced to switch to this application. On the second day of use, I receive a fine for an error in the registration (which is preselected in the application). I get in touch quickly to correct it, and they wash their hands, the only thing they give me are excuses about the design of the application that leads to user error and they give me a link to the town hall website to appeal the fine on my own . I will not use it again or recommend it to absolutely anyone, there are other alternatives.;1;2021-02-18;15.16.0_rc2
4353;Carlos Urzaiz;I also come from epark .. And I can only say that I am very sorry for his disappearance. Easy park is a real disaster. Yesterday they passed me by obligation to this monstrosity. It is not intuitive. It does not report on the new conditions, or it does so in a cryptic way. It does not allow confirmation of parking, so if a mistake is made, either by the user or by the application, there is no going back. Yesterday I was testing the application from my home, since I had to go to Madrid an hour and a half later. He tells me at 5:50 p.m. that I am parked, and that it ended at 7:19 p.m. without giving the option to confirm, I called by phone and there was no way to go back. They blamed the City Council. And to me the anger for not reading the conditions I have entered the application several times and there is no way. It is possible that I am stupid, as they came to suggest, but as I see from the opinions, there are many of us. It is possible that the application is only for gifted people, so I will unsubscribe as soon as the claim that I have filed with the City Council is resolved. In the end I parked at twenty past six with the uncertainty of the possibility that four hours would pass and end up sanctioned. Fortunately, it was not. In short, a disaster. They tease you once and they run out of a customer.;1;2021-02-18;15.16.0_rc2
4354;Raquel P. Sanchez;I did not like the other e-park app, it was much easier and more intuitive and it had a virtual wallet that it does not have, also this application charges you a commission while the other one did not, I will have to look for another app;1;2021-02-18;15.16.0_rc2
4355;Jose L. Garcia;Having an active 'card', the mobility agent wanted to fine me because my car did not appear with a card. It means that the application does not send the information in a timely manner to the system. PAINFUL. If it becomes a camera car, they give me a FIXED fine.;3;2021-02-17;15.16.0_rc2
4356;Carlos Villajos;I install it to consume the balance of the previous epark, but as soon as it runs out it goes out and I go back to the parking meters ... To steal 10% of the parking lot from somewhere else, gentlemen.;1;2021-02-17;15.16.0_rc2
4357;César Pérez;Epark was free and now it forces you to go to easy park and they charge you 10% of the parking fee. Good scam.;1;2021-02-17;15.17
4358;J M Foronda;It forces you to leave the old app and they charge you 10% apart from parking ... see you!;1;2021-02-17;15.16.0_rc2
4359;Fernando dlp;Abuse in commissions! I have paid 0.23 for parking in the blue zone of which 0.18 is the EasyPark commission. I understand that they take a commission for the service but they take more than the City Council itself! A theft;1;2021-02-17;15.16.0_rc2
4360;Emi redex;Very good until the migration, they charge you a commission for the use of the application, which may be reasonable, but I do not plan to pay of course. I will look for other alternatives. Bye-bye.;1;2021-02-17;15.16.0_rc2
4361;Guadalupe Mata;Terrible app. They charge you commissions. Very difficult to control payments because they pass them when they want.;1;2021-02-17;15.16.0_rc2
4362;Jose Matellanes;You have bought the only free app and it does not contribute anything. It works worse. It is a real disaster.;1;2021-02-17;15.16.0_rc2
4363;Rafael Herrera Nardone;A failure in the application placed the car on another street, for which I have been sanctioned.;1;2021-02-16;15.16.0_rc2
4364;Harold de los bosques;He takes your money and does not take care of you. He sets the prices he wants (abusive and indecent) and does not pick up the phone. A fraud. In the end I managed to talk to someone, of course everything was fine and the price of 5 minutes in Legazpi at 1.38 euros would be a specific failure. Uninstall now;1;2021-02-16;15.16.0_rc2
4365;Jesus Granda;I think it is more expensive than E-park;1;2021-02-15;15.16.0_rc2
4366;Alvaro Drake;Is a gotcha. You go from an application that does not charge you to one that charges you a commission for each parking lot. In addition, it does not allow you to put the ticket for the next day. It does not work well. It is unintuitive and zero practice. I do not recommend it at all.;1;2021-02-15;15.16.0_rc2
4367;José María Guerrero Vidal;Fail, fail and fine. Recently migrated from smspark to EasyPark, I put the code 1339 for Sweden and it leaves Norway, on the map all 133x except 1339 appear, not even looking for it manually on the map, DOES NOT EXIT, I park for a moment and when I arrive, a fine. Congratulations, your app serves to fine you. Develop it properly. I see that I am not the only one with these problems, and now the fine to pay ...;1;2021-02-15;15.16.0_rc2
4368;Goretti Carrillo;They forced me to switch to this application to pay the ORA and it doesn't go well. It is impossible to make the payment;1;2021-02-14;15.16.0_rc2
4369;Patolo Sanchez;It does not notify you when the ticket is about to expire. And it has a really ugly design, epark was a much more professional and better looking app;1;2021-02-14;15.16.0_rc2
4370;JOSE DEOIZ;I had EPARK, and I liked it much more, I had to change forced;1;2021-02-14;15.16.0_rc2
4371;Render;I give it one because I can't give it zero. I used ePark and this App has absorbed it. Much worse the interface than before with ePark. Once you put in a time you cannot extend it until the time is up. Big mistake. Also, I just found out that they now charge me a commission that they didn't before.;1;2021-02-13;15.16.0_rc2
4372;David de la Hoz;It does not let me recharge money, because the option does not appear directly;1;2021-02-12;15.16.0_rc2
4373;Toni Rod Cim;Very unintuitive. To extend hours it gives you the option but does not confirm that it is done and you run the risk of paying more;2;2021-02-12;15.16.0_rc2
4374;Toni;I want to go back to the other e-park App. This new one charges me an extra percentage for using it, for that I prefer to use the traditional parking meter, I was not informed when I was going to migrate from that extra, only when I had already migrated. How can I return my money to the other App or to my account?;1;2021-02-12;15.16.0_rc2
4375;Younes Elkouarti;It won't let me delete my debit card. It is a m..da of application. It is reportable !!!;1;2021-02-12;15.16.0_rc2
4376;Oscar Gesto Pedreira;I have updated the old e-park app to this one. I have not looked at the migration conditions, and I have noticed that I paid € 0.18 for management on my € 1.30 tickets. The city of La Coruña is an exception and would not have to pay a commission After moving from the standard package to the basic package, these commissions are no longer paid. The change must be done on the easypark website and contacting them. The attention is unbeatable and super fast.;5;2021-02-12;15.16.0_rc2
4377;Marta Martinez;Catastrophic mistake, I don't like it at all. In addition to being much more uncomfortable and unintuitive than e-park charges you more. Fatal.;1;2021-02-12;15.16.0_rc2
4378;Fernando Rubio;LA-DRO-NES;1;2021-02-12;15.16.0_rc2
4379;Mercedes Folgado;It was E-Park, which worked wonderfully, but now that it has changed to EasyPark they charge me much more than before and the application is horrible, I don't know how to recharge as before and it asks me to incorporate a card whenever I use it.;1;2021-02-11;15.16.0_rc2
4380;LA CENTRAL JEREZANA;Great application to pay only for the time you have parked and everything from your mobile no matter where you are. In addition, two queries that I have made on your customer service phone have been resolved quickly. Long live technology.;5;2021-02-11;15.16.0_rc2
4381;Isabel Díaz Romero;Nothing comfortable. Too far-fetched. And after accepting the change it is impossible to return to the normal E-Park app.;1;2021-02-10;15.16.0_rc2
4382;Elena Vicent;I already made the request for the refund and they tell me that the balance was € 0 in the e-park account, which is false because I had money. They keep the money of all the people who used it. They think that for € 5 they are not going to claim it and in the end they get together with a lot of money.;1;2021-02-10;15.16.0_rc2
4383;Javier Meré Marcos;It's crap compared to epark. They force you to change. Intuitive zero;1;2021-02-10;15.16.0_rc2
4384;TTT CCC;It is the scam of the stamp ... they pass you from a free application, epark, to easypark that after a month of operation begins to charge (in a car park of € 1.40, € 0.18 of easypark service, at least 10% say ) .... when it begins to charge you a month has passed, it no longer lets you operate with EPARK. I will stop using it. VERY BAD, very dissatisfied. Abiding by RGPD ... In addition to removing it, what do I have to do to get my account and data from the easypark company deleted?;1;2021-02-10;15.16.0_rc2
4385;Rocio Za;TIMO all the way up with the money from the other application and they do not let you see the previous data of course I have captures made to the balance that I had left and with the email that they have sent me that I have no left I will go to make the corresponding complaint . Do not download it, it is a scam of someone without shame who wants to keep people's money;1;2021-02-10;15.16.0_rc2
4386;Carlos Pradal;I have gone from a free app to a paid one without any consent and they have transferred the balance to me. I want my money back, not transferred between your accounts.;1;2021-02-10;15.16.0_rc2
4387;Marian Herrera;They charge a lot more than the previous one, I don't like it at all. And it is impractical. I unsubscribe.;1;2021-02-10;15.14.1
4388;Luis Gonzalo;It is a scam. They say that when they go from e-park they keep the balance and in my case it is not true. Then they charge an outrageous commission.;1;2021-02-09;15.16.0_rc2
4389;Mónica Romero;I am going to uninstall it and pay at the parking meter, it is a joke in bad taste that for stopping 5 minutes the app takes 15 cents at least. I know there are no free applications in Madrid, it still seems like a robbery to me. For when a city council app that is free and makes life easier for the citizen? Ah, no, not that ... well, it's time to walk to the parking meter.;1;2021-02-09;15.16.0_rc2
4390;Jorge Albesa;Sorry, much more expensive than epark and worse service;1;2021-02-09;15.16.0_rc2
4391;Luis Rafael González Pérez;Despite the fact that in Coruña they say that there is an option without additional expense, it is a lie. They charge € 0.18 for every two hours. They are scammers. They do not give the option of parking without extra cost when they say it exists.;1;2021-02-09;15.16.0_rc2
4392;Davinia Moreno;I can't believe what happened today with this application ... I was from E-park but now they have been associated with this gang of Thieves ... I had € 1.50 in my account and it was from 18:39 to 19:15 I did not have enough balance in the green zone and my vehicle is ECO with which it has a 50% discount ... I am very sorry but they give it for C ... To this application ... To rob someone else .. .;1;2021-02-08;15.16.0_rc2
4393;Juan Antonio Ruiz lopez;Fatal, it charges a lot of commission and it is not better than others, it is not worth it, they hide what it charges from you. Fuck ... I'm going to another;1;2021-02-08;15.16.0_rc2
4394;raquel saavedra hernandez;Very bad!! This in theory is easier ?? 😂😂 It is not intuitive or easy for me.;1;2021-02-08;15.16.0_rc2
4395;Diego Martinez;Mandatory change from epark to easy park. Functions are lost and the cost for use in A Coruña rises if you don't want to lose them. End to balance recharges, so the use of your bank details is constant. A big step back.;1;2021-02-08;15.16.0_rc2
4396;Alvaro Villacieros;They do not clearly warn of the commission charge every time you use it, nor does it warn that once changed you cannot return, if I find out before I do not make the change since you can continue using e-Park and then decide if you want to or not pay the commission of these gentlemen. As soon as my balance ends, I delete the application.;1;2021-02-08;15.16.0_rc2
4397;Celia Arnelas;They steal your money. They force you to go to this app where they charge you commissions and there is no way to get a refund of the balance. Be careful because they contact you by phone (phone that you have to give as an obligation for registration, at no time for commercial telephone contact), in breach of European data protection law, after leaving a negative review in the play store. I will claim in consumption.;1;2021-02-08;15.16.0_rc2
4398;Guillermo Garcia;They charge commission, 10%!;1;2021-02-08;15.16.0_rc2
4399;Mariano CARAVANTES ALTAMIRANO;It is a scam. They charge 10 percent. Downloading proof of payment does not tell you what day it is. It is to be outlined. But charging is very strong.;1;2021-02-08;15.16.0_rc2
4400;Gema;I don't want to call any phone and talk to anyone, I just want you like many others to tell us what to do to get our money back.;1;2021-02-07;15.16.0_rc2
4401;fran palos;They overcharge you. The app takes money every time you park through it. In addition to the cost of the parking meter, they charge you "... a maximum of 10% of the parking of the parking price, with a minimum of € 0.10 or € 0.15 depending on the municipality." I wish we had been contacted before forcing us to migrate our e-park account, where there were no commissions. If the parking meter already seemed expensive, having to pay even more ... We will have to find another app or go back to the coins.;1;2021-02-07;15.16.0_rc2
4402;Eduardo Perez;It is a robbery, better with the difference between epark, they charge you 0.18 For everything, for opening the ticket, for extending the time, with epark it did not happen, I used it a lot when I went to look for my daughter at school, for 15 min but now I pay more in commission than the cost of parking,;1;2021-02-06;15.15.1
4403;M L;Great application, comfortable, fast and easy to use.;5;2021-02-06;15.16.0_rc2
4404;Auga Salus;Watch out! By accepting the application change, which they impose on you, they charge you even if you park outside of the collection hours, nobody explains it to you if you don't call, but they have already stolen money from you. Some thieves! City Hall and Easy park wash their hands too. I put the ticket before 4 o'clock and if you want to pay until 6 o'clock, they charge you more than 1.30, and when they explain what to do and you do it, then they do not let you access the normal conditions such as for example. ticket extension as before.;1;2021-02-06;15.16.0_rc2
4405;MARCIAL CÁCERES;Easy, intuitive and practical.;5;2021-02-05;15.16.0_rc2
4406;Miguel Angel Pérez Díaz;It works Fatal. The previous e-park app was infinitely better.;1;2021-02-05;15.16.0_rc2
4407;O C F B A;It seems to me a robbery that they charge to use the application.;1;2021-02-04;15.16.0_rc2
4408;Mery S.M.;When making the transfer from Epark to EasyPark, they did not charge me my previous balance ... Finally, after calling on 2 occasions they assisted me and they solved all the doubts and the balance problem, a guy called Enmanuel assisted me and he has been very professional and kind.;4;2021-02-04;15.15.1
4409;Pink Cbd;But why have they changed to WORSE !! Now they CHARGE COMMISSIONS for using it, it is less intuitive and they have told me about the same car, at the same time, that I am parked in a blue and green zone at the same time. I unsubscribe;1;2021-02-04;15.15.1
4410;FELIPE MARTINEZ;Horrible. You pay 4 times more than before with e-park. Forced to switch to this application so as not to lose my balance, before in Madrid I used to spend 10 minutes for 5 cents, now they charge me 23 cents !!!! A scam !! . As soon as my balance runs out, goodbye. There are other better options.;1;2021-02-03;15.15.1
4411;Maite B;An application disaster. In addition to charging a supplement, complaints cannot be canceled as with Epark. A shame about the change.;1;2021-02-03;15.15.1
4412;Luis Aguilar;I can't see the balance. There is no online support. A disaster. It appeared a few hours later. The migration process from one app to another is not very intuitive. Honestly, I prefer the above. Thanks for the reply;1;2021-02-03;15.16.0_rc2
4413;ANGEL REBOSO MONTOYA;I think the app is pretty good in general. I like the design and the different functionalities it has. The handicap of migration is important, I mean that with the old epark you ensured the digital payment of the parking meter, with a cost of € 0, and quite acceptable functionalities. It costs the one that now has to pay a commission, and also high, because in short installments, for example 0.15 cts. you pay more in commission than in the cost of the parking itself. Lights and shadows.;3;2021-02-02;15.15.1
4414;Alain Rodriguez;Magnificent customer service I have been unsubscribed as soon as I have asked for it, now the app does not adjust to my interests for 1 ° too much commission for the time of my tickets lower than 0.9 € 2 ° is payment by card, I prefer card purse, I don't want to have my card inserted in the mobile 3 ° looking for parking is not useful it does not work well If they change their payment method I will consider going back;3;2021-02-02;15.15.1
4415;Angel Garcia;I would like to withdraw my balance because I no longer use it. Now they charge me VAT, which they didn't before. The app must be sustained with the saving of paper and ink from the parking meters or service commission by the interested parties. Not at the expense of the consumer, who is also obliged to pay VAT on their seized balance from another application that did not charge it. In short, 1 hour in Santander 75cts with the 91 app, 21% more expensive than putting in the coins;1;2021-02-02;15.15.1
4416;Pedro Rodríguez;I had € 10 credit in epark and they did not transfer me to easypark. I called customer service and they solved the issue for me. Hence the perfect customer service. The application works fine but I think the commission is high. Therefore hence the 4 star;4;2021-02-02;15.15.1
4417;silvia boedo;I did not receive the verification text, although I had already put it. This application does not work, the other one was better. I will have it installed because I already had money in epark. After talking to customer support solved;3;2021-02-02;15.15.1
4418;Carlos Obregón Ruesta;It does not convince me. I should go back to E-Park. I have regretted it because it does not matter how much time you use that the € 0.18 you eat with potatoes yes or yes. As soon as the balance I had from E-Park runs out, I'll go back to it, and if it doesn't leave, I'll go to TelPark. And it's not that I uninstall the app, no, it's that I unsubscribe, let's go. Everyone already trades with the information they have about one. TOTAL DISASTER EASYPARK;1;2021-02-02;15.16.0_rc2
4419;Mathä;Now to pay commission or to touch the parking meters in times of pandemic ... How do you take advantage ...;1;2021-02-01;15.15.1
4420;Juan Carlos Pinero;They force you to change your epark and it turns out that they charge a commission, in short, disappointed;1;2021-02-01;15.16.0_rc2
4421;Familia Martín Wickham;What a scam. Perfectly reportable. Toni, I want you to return the balance I had in the application. From now on I will walk to the nearest parking meter. What are you the cheapest service? And what competition do you have? You have a captive market and you are taking advantage of it. Kindly I tell you Toni, I want you to return my money.;1;2021-02-01;15.15.1
4422;Julu Arcu;Before with epark the service was free, now in addition to paying for street parking, I have to pay for a service that was previously free. You cannot tell me that you have to maintain the application when the service was free before. Worst of all, we let these rabble play with our money and our patience. At least if you offered new and useful services it would be worth paying, but you do not even offer anything new compared to the above.;1;2021-02-01;15.15.1
4423;Silvia Zara;I just came from E-park and I see that this is not free.;1;2021-01-31;15.15.1
4424;Ana De La Iglesia;Horrible, the worst, nothing intuitive, I go around a thousand times to start parking or recharge. My city council has forced to change it for this application and it takes less time to go down to the street to put money than to set the time from here;1;2021-01-30;15.15.1
4425;J C V;Very unhappy with the migration to this app, the balance of the previous one was not loaded automatically. I have sent email but I do not have a response yet.;1;2021-01-30;15.15.1
4426;Roberto Pérez;Don't go from E-park to Easypark !!!! I have passed automatically, but they have not respected the balance that I had loaded, but what is this !!!!!!! I mean, full-blown SCAM. Also, it is more expensive.;1;2021-01-30;15.15.1
4427;Javier Lopez;Very simple and intuitive;4;2021-01-30;15.15.1
4428;Man All In;As simple and easy as e-park was, what a way to complicate things.;1;2021-01-30;15.15.1
4429;Alvaro Gonzalez;It was easier to use the previous e-park. But intuitive.;1;2021-01-29;15.15.1
4430;Francisco Teocrates;The application shows a lot of simplicity, it is pretty striking but the problem is that they have started to charge a commission for use when before in epark from where I have migrated it was not like that and I do not agree with it. Nor am I going to recommend it and I will warn everyone who may that before the service was free and now it is paid by commission. Greetings to all.;2;2021-01-29;15.15.1
4431;Rosa Rodriguez Diaz;It is very difficult to handle. I am very sorry for the forced change from e-park, an easy-to-use application, to easypark to which we have been subjected. Regretful and unhappy user. Easypark's answer to Don Gato is simplistic to say the least. E-park did all that but in a simple way and at no added cost;1;2021-01-29;15.15.1
4432;melchor docampo;I had an e-park and I had to change it for easypark because the first one disappeared. And everything has gotten worse, less intuitive when paying for regulated parking and the wallet option disappears, that is, now they charge you directly on the card, not recharges in the application itself.;1;2021-01-28;15.15.1
4433;Victor Aguayo;Well, while I was installing it because it forced me to change epark, I have read the comments and ... deleted instantly. Changes are not always for the better. Feedback from people should make you think. I stay with the app that was, since I came to this one because I thought it was without commission and I see that it is the same or more expensive. All the best;1;2021-01-28;15.15.1
4434;Juan Alonso de Velasco;It forces you to give your credit card details. It does not work with an electronic wallet. E-Park was much simpler and safer. I don't like change at all.;1;2021-01-27;15.15.1
4435;Rafael Téllez Quemada;I had been using e-park since its inception and had never had a single problem. I received a € 60 fine because the application did not connect correctly with the mobile's GPS, obtaining a ticket from another neighborhood located about 6 km away. The parking place I have repeated many times with e-park because it is the area of ​​my dentist. In addition, in e-park, the precision in meters of the position appeared another glitch for the app interface that has clearly gotten worse with the update;1;2021-01-27;15.15.1
4436;Manuel Martínez;We have lost out with the change. With E-park it was very easy and fast to put a ticket.;1;2021-01-27;15.15.1
4437;Fernando Prados;They charge for everything, before epark much better, I request an immediate balance refund. After your answer only indicate that they actually charge whoever wants to be charged, in my case I will not use your application again and I will look for a better one. I will also inform my acquaintances about how this application works. Greetings;1;2021-01-27;15.15.1
4438;Luis Martin;Epark was simpler. It made it possible to pay for two cars at the same time and it was more convenient, from my point of view, to be able to recharge.;2;2021-01-27;15.15.1
4439;Juan de Dios Ruiz Valero;A disaster .. How horrible. !!;1;2021-01-27;15.15.1
4440;Carmen Parra;Confusing and difficult.;2;2021-01-27;15.14.1
4441;Isabel Isa;Fast and accurate;5;2021-01-27;15.15.1
4442;Alejandro Ramírez;Abusive rates. It is only worth it if you are going to park for long periods. Before absorbing e-park it had a free use, you paid for what you parked, now it does not matter how long you stop and they will charge you € 0.20 for your face, it is not that it is much, but if the time you stop to pick up something it costs you the same as the fee for using the app ... I don't find any sense. Very disappointed with the change.;1;2021-01-27;15.15.1
4443;enrique gutierrez ruiz;I do not understand the change, everything for the worse, choosing the area an odyssey, carrying the impossible balance, paying a very complicated infraction. Before everything simple. What need is there to get worse?;1;2021-01-26;15.15.1
4444;pablo bernal;Wrong, I come from epark and it is also worse, it charges me a 10% commission in Madrid (epark did not charge). It no longer allows me to use epark again. I feel cheated.;1;2021-01-26;15.15.1
4445;Alba Jiménez;This is rubbish! Call it easy, it doesn't! He has not let me use the old application, only an image appeared telling me to switch to this one. After I did it, it turns out that you even have to put the name of the street, a code and locate it on the map. Come on, a total waste of time. I want to keep the old app !!;1;2021-01-26;15.15.1
4446;Pedro Palop;Bad experience. I preferred the old epark. It does not allow canceling a parking lot if you have not used it. That is, before leaving the vehicle as soon as the parking lot started, I decided that I should follow the route and I was not going to park. But I could not recover the amount of the ticket. They are going to charge and period;1;2021-01-26;15.15.1
4447;JOPILLA CHICA;IT IS THE WORST PARKING APPLICATION I HAVE EVER USED, Ojooo they charge a very expensive commission without being clear DO NOT DOWNLOAD !!!!;1;2021-01-25;15.15.1
4448;Pablo Pérez Pérez;Shameful!! Very expensive for a service that e-park did not charge any commission or minimum fee, being able to pay parking from € 0.05 for example in an ECO car and now the minimum fee is € 0.19 or € 0.29 ... I don't think use this application as long as they do not withdraw all the commissions, service fees or whatever they want to call it and are equal to e-park where you only paid for parking ... And I will take care of notifying all my contacts of the same and its abusive costs . A shame!!;1;2021-01-25;15.14.1
4449;Carlos Sevillano;Very bad, not intuitive and 18 cents of commission in 20 cents of ticket ... authentic usurers.;1;2021-01-24;15.15.1
4450;Vigaria J;Horrible, I do not know how to cancel the reports from the app. It refers you to a website where you have to enter data. A delay compared to epark. Epark much better a pity that it has stopped working. Remove an application to move on to a worse one. Of course I will remove myself as soon as I manage to eliminate my transferred balance.;1;2021-01-23;15.14.1
4451;Miguel Ángel Suárez;Be careful;1;2021-01-23;15.15.1
4452;Concepción Constantina Martín-Consuegra Garrido;I had a problem entering the license plate, I called and they fixed it for me. Thank you! Fantastic attention;5;2021-01-22;15.15.1
4453;jogarceb;Quick and easy, why more ...?;5;2021-01-22;15.15.1
4454;elpachocho chocho;With this application you have gone back and forth since it does not allow you to put only one ticket to a car and the ticket history does not appear to be able to demonstrate that your car (in case of sanction) had the ticket at the established time;1;2021-01-21;15.15.1
4455;Bea Santos;I do not like the application at all it was better e-park is a drag and they backfire on messages all day;1;2021-01-20;15.15.1
4456;Oscar T.Sanmartin;SCAM, I have been forced to migrate from e-park to this app, they have not informed me of the 18 cents of commission on each payment and they have destroyed the functionality and clarity that we users had. They have removed the recharge bag and now my bank statement is full of small recharges that make it very difficult to consult my movements. HORRIBLE APP AND HORRIBLE ABUSIVE PRACTICES. Edito: To / To Tony and to the other READY to migrate The conditions and terms are in ENGLISH, which nose do you have.;1;2021-01-20;15.15.1
4457;Cristina Ochoa;More expensive than the previous application and more cumbersome. I add after your answer that in comparison to the previous epark app that is still in force and which you do not allow to return to, there is almost 10 CTS of difference. With which the costs can be adjusted.;1;2021-01-20;15.15.1
4458;Charly Brown;It is very complicated to use and they charge you 10% to use the application. E-Park is much easier to use and visually more attractive;1;2021-01-20;15.15.1
4459;Akasha Ankh;More expensive. How can I get a refund of the balance that was automatically added to the previous app. I do not want to continue with this app and I want my money back.;1;2021-01-19;15.15.1
4460;Jose Angel Arias;I was disappointed when switching from epark to this new app. I would like you to take epark as a sample, simple but much more intuitive. Analyze why there are so many complaints and you will realize that it is largely due to its structure and development. Try to make an app similar to epark because otherwise you will be left with very few customers. Epark was very intuitive. It is a simple recommendation. And maybe that's it, that the general public wants something simple and that goes well. Greetings;2;2021-01-19;15.15.1
4461;Ana P;Best epark;1;2021-01-19;15.15.1
4462;raul lopez;Since the transfer from Epark to Easypark I can only define it as disastrous. I have been charged twice for the same amount of time. They have not passed the balance that you had in the previous app. Fatal. I edit after speaking with customer service. Even worse. First I explain everything by phone and they tell me to delete and install the app and explain everything again by email. And by email they answer me that 2 accounts have been created, one with a balance and the other without a balance. Let him install and uninstall. ZERO solutions.;1;2021-01-19;15.15.1
4463;Don Fag;Ideal application if you want to pay a 10% surcharge, with a minimum of 15 euro cents plus VAT (18 cents in total) for each car park. Perfect, if you don't want to have coins in your pocket and you prefer that others have them for you. I do not see any advantage and yes a setback compared to before, and as soon as I spend my balance I will use coins or cards again. I am not for donations.;1;2021-01-18;15.15.1
4464;Fatima Varela;I don't like it, Epark was much better, to annul a sanction you have to enter the city, registration etc ... Why ??? If the car is already in the app and the area where it is parked ??? And why do I have to put the exact street where my car is if I am not near it? If I do not remember the name of the street? I have my husband's license plate saved and sometimes, exceptionally, he tells me to put money in for his car, if I don't know the street is IMPOSSIBLE ... I don't like it at all, I'm sorry ...;1;2021-01-17;15.15.1
4465;Dionisio bueno garcia;I don't give it any stars, it's bad like the one who implanted it. A real fraud in everything and everything.;1;2021-01-16;15.15.1
4466;Juan Carlos Conde;e-park worked great and free, this is a commission-charged garbage and misses more than a fairground shotgun. As soon as the balance ends, I uninstall.;1;2021-01-16;15.15.1
4467;J.R. Igual;Bad. Do not install!;1;2021-01-15;15.15.1
4468;Nacho;I used e-park, which in my opinion gave this application a thousand times, without commissions, and simple. Now that I have had to change to this one, in which they take 10% of the cost of parking as a cap, it is not worth keeping it. Uninstalled;1;2021-01-15;15.15.1
4469;Alfonso HdC;He was a user of e.park. when the balance runs out I will stop using this.;1;2021-01-15;15.15.1
4470;Gonzalo;So with the move to the new application do you charge me a surcharge for each parking lot? I would attach the screenshot of the conditions. But it does not leave me the application. All advantages of the move from epark to easy and expensive Park;1;2021-01-15;15.15.1
4471;Eva Zafra;Since with epark they did not charge commission and it was with whom I contracted, I would like to be reimbursed the balance. Since when he told me that I had to change to be able to use it, no one told me that it was with commission. I am not willing to pay it so I want the refund of my balance with epark.;1;2021-01-15;15.15.1

4476;Tasia Tasia;Very good;5;2021-01-14;15.12.3
4477;Pedro García Domingo;Very difficult to locate the area where you have parked if you do it manually, epark would give it 100 laps, simple and without complications, when I run out of balance I change the application. And as we know the Area code, an application delay that complicates more than it facilitates.;1;2021-01-13;15.15.1
4478;Roberto Gonzalez Gonzalez;You charge separately for everything. PvP parking + 0.18 + VAT (how do you spend ....) And to top it all. € 0.10 per SMS sent to notify the end of the ticket .. Nefarious .... Abusive rates ... Let e-park come back ......;1;2021-01-13;15.15.1
4479;Alberto C.;# ATTENTION USERS FROM A CORUÑA # if you do not want to pay the commissions of this app, you have to enter the easyPark website with your user and migrate to an easyPark BASIC account (profile tab, at the bottom). That way you will stop paying the commissions for parking, only in A Coruña city.;1;2021-01-13;15.15.1
4480;santi coruna;A fucking scam, rather several together. Only one car, problems paying the fines, very high commission, you can't top up, Galician is still in Spanish and you think we're stupid ... We'll press the council to create our own application or use another one and not collect the coins in the parking meter.;1;2021-01-13;15.15.1

4482;Jose Manuel Cernadas;Excessive cost. Instead of improving we got worse, I was delighted with e-park and now there is no other option but to change to this, so we will have to go back to the parking meter of a lifetime. The world upside down...;1;2021-01-13;15.15.1
4483;Alberto C.;Beware of this application !! The first one comes out when you are looking for another, which can lead to confusion. They charge for parking, sometimes the commission is more expensive than the time parked. Void customer service !!!;1;2021-01-13;15.15.1
4484;Kati Boop;1 °) Before you parked at an hour that was not charged, you activated the parking and it was adjusted to the start time. Now you park at three, you activate the parking lot and it charges you the same, it no longer fits. 2) I went to park right now, I entered the APP and it just "told me" 'your easy park account has been created' they immediately sent me a code and asked for my information again and my card number ... I already had an account, when did I delete it? Oh sure, NEVER. I don't know what happens but I hope they fix it ...;1;2021-01-13;15.15.1

4486;MIGUEL ANGEL DIEZ;I used E-park for a long time, until it became integrated into Easy Park. Now they charge commission and everything is much more complicated. Uninstalled both.;1;2021-01-12;15.15.1

4488;Iñaki Guerra Larrabeiti;I will use up the remaining balance of epark and uninstall it. Reason: the 10% commission that is applied in Madrid. We will return to the parking meter at street level. I will lose the comfort of renewing the ticket remotely or I will look for another alternative;1;2021-01-08;15.14.1
4489;darkdevil Varela;Not bad the following, and park was more intuitive, easy to use and faster, also charging you 0.18 cents for management seems to me an armed robbery when epark was free;1;2021-01-08;15.14.1
4490;Ana Lorite Melgar;I do not think it is very lawful or legal that, having a balance involved, they force us to switch to another app that has management costs without giving the option of returning that credit and, therefore, leaving it up to the consumer what to do with a money that voluntarily at the time dedicated to a purpose. I do not know if you have this contemplated in the app or if there is any option of "free for epark" but it is something that I am going to consult with the OCU.;1;2021-01-08;15.14.1
4491;Rosa Mª López-Maroto;DO NOT CHANGE With how good I was with E-park I made the change thinking it was mandatory and it is a disaster and very expensive ... When my balance runs out I look for another option. How could I think it would get worse and more expensive? Do not make my mistake and continue with the previous one;1;2021-01-07;15.14.1
4492;Sergio Valverde;As soon as the balance I brought from e-park ends, I will unsubscribe from this application. There is no interest in a service that inflates a parking price that is already expensive in Madrid.;1;2021-01-07;15.14.1
4493;Javier;I do not understand that they have to charge me a commission, and a minimum of 15 cents (which can be more). The service of charging through APP should be financed or by advertising (as has been done so far) or paid by the City Council (since it is a service yours). Do I also pay the person who checks if I have taken a ticket and if not fine? Do I pay a commission at Carrefour for having someone charge me at the checkout? No, that is paid by Carrefour from its earnings. Well, the City Council ... Uninstalled!;1;2021-01-07;15.14.1
4494;Pierina Gomez;I need to know if it is enough to uninstall the app to unsubscribe ... the prices they have are incredible ... the change was for the worse. I do not know if it only happens to me but I have not used the car for a few days and in the app and they continue to charge me ... this is worse than the bank commissions🤢🤢😤;1;2021-01-07;15.14.1
4495;maria del mar Ordóñez;He advised me to switch from the e-park q easypark application .... this one charges me and the previous one does not and now it does not let me use the previous one .... a joke ..... to charge me I prefer to go to parking meter.

4496;Ignacio P;A SCAM. I have a hybrid car and you charge me a minimum commission more than it costs me to park. They say that they warn of the commissions, but neither I nor others have seen them in e-park. The minimum commission is higher than the cost of the service in my case (absurd). The last straw is the arrogance in the response, which "will process the withdrawal personally". We used e-park because it was simple and had no commissions. If they don't listen to customers ...;1;2021-01-06;15.14.1
4497;Maria Teresa Garcia Lledó;Disastrous. I erase myself. I turn to the parking meter. It seems that the purpose is to make life difficult for people. And have them controlled. Congratulations!!! You have done it.;1;2021-01-06;15.14.1
4498;Yéssica CzS;They force me to install it from the park and it is not the same because easypark CHARGES COMMISSION. DO NOT TOUCH THE PINK BUTTON. In response to your comment: if I don't install it, I lose the balance I have in my e-park account, so I do feel obligated if I don't want to lose MY MONEY. >> They have contacted me and activated the option to NOT PAY COMMISSION in MY usual CITY, which is Coruña. With which, they have partially solved the problem and I am happy with the attention received. <<;3;2021-01-05;15.14.1
4499;David Alvarez;Another user unhappy about the switch from EPark to EasyPark. I am not going to elaborate on the causes because other users have commented on them perfectly. The only thing that I contribute is the infumable transfer invoice that you have prepared: transfer fees, negative balance in invoice ... that I cannot pass as a business expense. How do you want users to be happy if we only lose money without prior notice of the change? I had Telpark downloaded which is obviously the one I will use.;1;2021-01-05;15.14.1
4500;Adolfo Garcia;Perfect;5;2021-01-05;15.14.1
4501;José Sánchez-Robles;This app is a disaster. You select the location on the map and then register the car park where you want. When they sanction you for it, they have not been responsible and indicate that the fault lies with the location of the mobile, even if the location appears well on the screen. The worst thing is that they do not store the traces of the connections so as not to have to take responsibility ... It seems that they have the business well set up with the Madrid city council.;1;2021-01-05;15.14.1
4502;Toni DEL AMO;I come from Epark and I see that they charge commission. As soon as my balance runs out, I will migrate to another App.;1;2021-01-04;15.14.1
4503;Dirt Di;CARE in A Coruña sometimes YOU ARE FINED even if you have paid the O. R. A in this application. Keep in mind that the administration does not facilitate claims either.;1;2021-01-04;15.14.1
4504;Juanjo Caro;You have swallowed a good application like e-park and you have annoyed us. Above you charge commission. Usurers;1;2021-01-04;15.14.1
4505;Miguel Angel Ortiz Marina;When you answer customer service, Worse. They adorn ineptness with nice words, instead of fixing bugs. Of course, the commissions well hidden in the use clauses, they keep them.;2;2021-01-04;15.14.1
4506;JJ dL;Expensive, slow and inefficient. I will use up the balance of e-park and uninstall.;1;2021-01-03;15.14.1
4507;Juan José Viegas;I start the year installing what seemed to be a comfort. I park for half an hour, which is 30 cents and they charge me 18 cents for the app service. So it has cost me 60% more expensive parking. Maybe comfortable but I'm not interested in paying so much. A shame In addition, he believed that it had no cost to the user.;1;2021-01-02;15.15.1
4508;Jesus Calvo;As an e-park user, I have to say that the (forced) change is disastrous, the fees charged by the app seem like a robbery, I will spend the balance and switch to telepark. I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT.;1;2021-01-02;15.14.1
4509;Javier Villodas;Forced to switch to this app from epark. It does not offer any advantage over epark, but it charges a very high commission, it seems to me an abuse, a service cost can be admitted, but not this exaggeration. I'll go back to the parking meter.;2;2021-01-02;15.14.1
4510;Milagros Martinez;Nothing functional and complicated to handle. I am going to see other applications that are simple for me such as e-park;1;2021-01-01;15.14.1
4511;Maricela Gaona;Lousy ... this could be easy quick ... but no ...;1;2020-12-31;15.14.1
4512;German Dario Londoño;Practical and safe, as it should be, thank you.;5;2020-12-31;15.14.1
4513;Ricardo Hernandez Flores;It is the first time that I have used the App since the Epark account passed and it has been difficult for me to locate on the map where I should park ... I do not feel safe and then as the fine falls I eat it and I imagine that EasyPark does not will take over. The changes have to go for the better or at least equal the previous App, I trust that EasyPark will come to this but please take into account that the App now is not up to Epark ... do not take it the wrong way but they have to improve it a lot.;1;2020-12-31;15.14.1
4514;Judith Sislian;This app is terrible. I come from e-park, which YES was CLEAR AND INTUITIVE. It will be necessary to use the street machines again, since, even on this, they charge. Who came up with EASYPARK? Marketing Tip: ENGORROSOPARK. What a mess...!;1;2020-12-30;15.14.1
4515;P.A. P.G.;"OFFENDERS" for a parking fee of 30 cents you charge 18 commission, 60%. You have no other name. Tell me how to recover the balance that I have already paid migrated from the previous application.;1;2020-12-30;15.14.1
4516;margarita naveira;They charge seniors on each ticket you pay with the application. In the previous one it was free. I keep it because I have a balance from the previous application. I hope to finish the balance and will try to find another payment method for my parking in A Coruña. I do not understand how the Council allows this.;1;2020-12-30;15.14.1
4517;David González Díaz;It does not work to cancel complaints, repeatedly and trying to see if I have a complaint and it is impossible, for work reasons I cannot go to the car to see if I have the paper for not remembering to set the time in due time, and it is already the second time I have complaints and I cannot cancel them from the application;2;2020-12-30;15.14.1
4518;Mario Marin;Easy and practical;5;2020-12-30;15.14.1
4519;José Pedro Barrionuevo Alonso;I switched from epark and I don't even like the horrible pink color. Expensive, difficult to use, does not warn of the weather ... Still? Come on, when the balance runs out ... GOODBYE !!!;1;2020-12-30;15.14.1
4520;Diego Brocos Oubel;Very bad and expensive, it was better e-park. On the web they tell you that before parking they tell you the cost of parking as you turn the wheel and nothing at all;1;2020-12-29;15.14.1
4521;Pablo Serantes;A SCAM. 0.18cts for each parking lot. They tell you it's the same as the old e-park, but IT'S A LIE. To take out paper again;1;2020-12-29;15.14.1
4522;Alejandro Aradas García;Like many other users that comes from e-park, the change was disastrous. The other was easier to use, the difference between the basic app and the other option is not clear, although I suppose there will be costs involved. I don't think it lets you have several tickets at the same time as before, that I managed my parents' car (who paid the hour without knowing where the car is). It also sends you to the web to see if there is a penalty and to be able to cancel it and in my case it gave an error. I was delighted with e-park.;1;2020-12-29;15.14.1
4523;lucia gallego;When. I want to go into removing the sanction, the truth does not take me to the page very badly;1;2020-12-29;15.14.1
4524;Fernando Rodriguez Ruiz;The application is very bad, not intuitive at all. It is not at all clear when it comes to fixing the parking lot, not even knowing if you have paid the ticket or not. Above they charge you an additional 10%. It was much better e-park. As soon as my balance runs out, I go back to the coins.;1;2020-12-29;15.14.1
4525;Pablo AP;THIS IS A FUCK OR THEFT. FORCING US TO GO FROM E-PARK TO THIS TO BLEED TO COMMISSIONS EVERY TIME I PARK. And how do I erase myself from you? I do not want them to have my data, my mobile, my credit card ... in any section of the app you can remove the visa, etc. Explain how I can delete the entire account and remove my visa. I am in my right! RE: MIGRATION MAKES IT COMPULSORY, A LAYER APPEARS IN THE APP THAT REDIRESTS AND GIVES NO OPTION TO CONTINUE USING E-PARK! CANNOT BE REMOVED;1;2020-12-28;15.14.1
4526;Juan Z;It is a shame that coming from ePark that did not charge commissions is if it does. I know it puts it in the conditions, but since I had money, I have not had another. How could I get tickets for two cars at the same time?;1;2020-12-28;15.14.1
4527;Dragomir Plamenov Denchev;It couldn't be done worse. I have it because they force me to have it. Very beautiful the color and everything, but more difficult it is impossible to do it. I take more than 30 minutes to recharge my balance here I am still, fooling around. I think in the end I will take a few coins in the glove compartment. Congratulations! Epack was fantastic, this basophy is the test of human patience!;1;2020-12-28;15.14.1
4528;Marco Martinez Gayoso;Little functional app. It takes more time to put the time in it than to go out to get a ticket. Impossible to see if you have a fine or not. The worst thing is that in the city of A Coruña the change is mandatory. I hope that the City Council changes its mind quickly or I will have to forget about the blue zone.;1;2020-12-28;15.14.1
4529;David Yebenes;I have just used E-Park and the change to easyPark has been worse, application less intuitive and with very high commissions that we did not have before, 10% of the service, for short parking you pay more for the "service" of easypark than for your own rate. As soon as the balance runs out, I uninstall it. A pity that we cannot continue enjoying E-park;1;2020-12-28;15.14.1
4530;eva;I liked the previous application more, in this one you have to go crazy to find the street where you had parked your car and reactivate it if you have spent time and are not around. The previous one did not ask you where the car was, adding the time was worth it.;2;2020-12-27;15.12.3
4531;Nacho Molinelli Fernández;We went from a bad application (Epark) to an infumable one (EasyPark). Once changed they no longer let you go back to the previous one. Lousy interface and constant crashes. You cannot see the complaints or cancel them from the app as in the other. They send you to the web and it doesn't work. Also now charges a commission for a worse service.;1;2020-12-26;15.14.1
4532;Bravo Victor;A 32-minute car park costs € 0.32 and a 10-minute car park costs € 0.30. For that I choose half an hour, if he charges you a minimum, it would be logical for him to give you at least half an hour. Personally I prefer the previous one.;1;2020-12-26;15.14.1
4533;Oscar Mora;It works Fatal, I do not see that they make improvements, if you have 2 vehicles, you cannot use the application simultaneously for both, it gives many errors, tested with different devices, little practice, to see if the municipalities look at the comments of the users;1;2020-12-26;15.14.1
4534;Antonio Plaza;Do not download this app ... it sneaks charges even if you do not use it ... today without using the app I have received a payment. Unbelievable I'll take action;1;2020-12-24;15.14.1
4535;Paloma Devora;Of course the other one was much better. She is very confused.;1;2020-12-24;15.14.1
4536;Simon Constanzo;Quick and easy. Very comfortable.;5;2020-12-24;15.14.1
4537;Javier Herrera;Migration from E-park, clearly for the worse. Aesthetically it is more striking, but of course in the previous one, its simplicity was its charm. I preferred advertising to paying management fees. What I recommended before now I can not continue doing. A real shame. We will have to look for alternatives. I hope they reconsider the conditions and resemble those of E-park. I edit to comment that he has called me Tony to comment very kindly on the new conditions and explain some doubts.;1;2020-12-24;15.14.1
4538;Inma García;Very bad application. Not very intuitive and having to enter data continuously. In epark, if you had the selected vehicle already carried out any operation ... nefarious and slow !!!;1;2020-12-24;15.14.1
4539;Mónica García;It does not let me choose the blue zone to pay. The previous application worked better;2;2020-12-23;15.14.1
4540;Antonio Moscat;I think it is a good application, with excellent and close customer service.;5;2020-12-23;15.14.1
4541;Alejandro Relaño;A real scam, much better was epark, they have sneaked it to us. I'm not going to give you one more euro;1;2020-12-22;15.14.1
4542;Alfonso Jove;User from A Coruña. With respect to the previous E-park application, I change for the worse, in everything. I am not informed about why the change, but this application is much worse. Very unhappy.;1;2020-12-22;15.14.1
4543;Alvaro Escribano;Hi there. App too expensive, € 0.18 for each parking is too much. Sometimes the commission is more important to me than the establishment itself. I am a user of epark and there they did not charge commission, they had advertising but somehow they had to have benefits but they were not passed on to the consumer. I'll go back to the parking meters on the street.;1;2020-12-22;15.14.1
4544;Fernando Perez;It is so bad that it drags on the work of the parking meter manufacturers. Apart from what was published before ... scam when going from epark ... commissions of up to 90% for parking in coruña .... poor telephone service .... they do not report the free option .... etc etc. ... oak every day I use it .... WORSE AS AN APP IS SIMPLE A F ***** ..... those of us who came from epark have come to much worse. IF IT IS NOT ESSENTIAL, DO NOT INSTALL IT;1;2020-12-22;15.14.1
4545;José Antonio De la Orden Gomez;They charge commission. They have no shame;1;2020-12-21;15.14.1
4546;Timir Ivanov;It does not work, the park button is not active! At last they called me for support, waiting for the area code ... ... the area code has arrived - it worked. But it was just one city - I can't ask for the parking code every time ... ... fix the app🤔;4;2020-12-21;15.14.1
4547;angel de dios;They have forced me to migrate from E Park. At no time have they told me that they were beginning to charge commissions or have communicated the rates, which I find unpresentable and I don't know if illegal. I don't see that a purse can be loaded. The application I do not like preferred the previous one. I will change the application. For seniors, I just saw that the rate is charged with initial ticetk and each time you extend the time. A theft;1;2020-12-21;15.14.1
4548;SUSANA CONDE;I was a regular user of e-park in my city, Santander, until I saw the breakdown of parking with the new easy park app (easy is an irony, right?) ... 10% commission! From now on I will always carry small coins ...;1;2020-12-21;15.14.1
4549;Wanda Lux;Fatal, I have parking for 5 euros that charged me 10, it seems like a total theft, I prefer to go to the parking meter, they charge me double my parking on top that I already left the car time I get a paste I do not recommend it at all, I am sending mail to claim my money but come on ,,,, I don't like it at all;1;2020-12-20;15.14.1
4550;Olga Gonzalez;It's not easy at all and I don't like it at all. Can someone explain to me how the balance is recharged? It is not at all intuitive as epark was, which was very simple;2;2020-12-19;15.14.1
4551;Pablo Martín García;painful. you pay commissions and it is much less intuitive than easy does not have anything we go. I do not know who would have come up with the change but he was not very clever.;1;2020-12-19;15.14.1
4552;Tania Sanjurjo;The new easy park application cannot be worse * Ticket sharing is no longer allowed * Continuous errors when loading credit with a card * having to enter the web to cancel the sanction * In Coruña, which used to be 30 cents for 15 minutes are now 48 !!! what you used to do in a minute now takes you 15. I hope the city council takes action and uses another application to pay the ORA;1;2020-12-19;15.14.1
4553;Andres Saiz;What a change and on top of that they rob you in the face;1;2020-12-19;15.14.1
4554;Carlos A.;They hide commissions. Lack of transparency. They are setting prices between companies in the sector. Forced to migrate from a free one to a paid one without informing. Abusive price regarding the service.;1;2020-12-19;15.14.1
4555;Javier Valdes;A fraud. I was in epark they tell you to migrate without turning back and you find out that they charge commissions. I'll use anything other than this one. I have no problem paying for services as long as they have not taken advantage of the good faith of the people when migrating from the application;1;2020-12-18;15.14.1
4556;Alvaro Alba;I came from e-park, an active user for quite some time. I did not realize it and I gave him to transfer to this new application thinking that it was the same or better. Not even close to the level of e-park. Not very intuitive, it charges for everything (previous termination notices, includes 0.18ct management fees) I have it clear, as soon as my balance runs out, I uninstall it. You cannot have such a tough face, now that there is no better advertising than what all of us who use it are going to do.;1;2020-12-18;15.14.1
4557;Armando;This application is much worse than the old one to say the least, you cannot trust it, it does not give exact places you have to recharge several times and it is more expensive Put the old one that was cheaper and more comfortable to use;1;2020-12-18;15.14.1
4558;Christian Giner Sánchez-Fortún;Very useful app to avoid having to be dependent on the street parking meter and having coins in your pocket. To improve: - To be able to stop the parking time in certain cities 🛑⏱️. - To be able to cancel / pay fines in certain cities 💸. If the review is useful to you, give 👍🏽.;4;2020-12-18;15.14.1
4559;Irene Z;The application did not register where my car was parked and put it in a location that was not nearby. I had many problems to find it, in Customer Service they not only did not help me but they treated me badly. I used it for the first and only time because I was migrated from e-Park, I recommend using any other application if you do not want to have problems.;1;2020-12-18;15.14.1
4560;jose luis palomares;Possibly when the balance runs out, I switch to another App. Epart was much faster and more manageable, I don't like this one.;5;2020-12-18;15.14.1
4561;Maria Marian;I want to delete my card as I do ... Then I will cancel my account thank you.;1;2020-12-17;15.14.1
4562;julio Fernandez;Very bad application, much simpler epark .. They have forced me to migrate .. As soon as my balance ends I unsubscribe. Much less usable and intuitive application than epark .. Change for the worse.;1;2020-12-17;15.14.1
4563;Maria Garcia;After critical and even negative reviews and being able to communicate by phone with them, I have to say that, in my case, the problem lies in a technical problem of information that the application gives the user, which leads to confusion about the use and cost of the application. app. Once explained by Tony, everything has been clarified and I have been able to confirm with my invoices that there is indeed no extra charge for the service. I do not give 5 * for this reason and I give it 4 * for good customer service;4;2020-12-17;15.14.1
4564;Daniel López;Another that comes from ePark and another that, as soon as the balance ends, goes out of business. Enough robbery is parking on the street to pay a commission, it seems to me already the last straw. Welcome to the park meters.;1;2020-12-17;15.14.1
4565;Fernando Meseguer;This is a scam, you migrate from Epark, it won't let you go back, and now it charges you commission. In addition, the use is much more complicated and unclear. A real shame of an app.;1;2020-12-17;15.14.1
4566;Angel Piedras;You go from epark that was not especially good to another that you can pay more commissions than parking meters.;1;2020-12-17;15.14.1
4567;Fit Bit;Deceit epark users. You trust them because epark was a very reliable free application. When you make the change you find out that they charge you. Jetas. I'll delete myself when the balance runs out. I say deception because they do not notify you of the collection of commissions. Quite high, by the way.;1;2020-12-17;15.14.1
4568;Ignacio Rodríguez López;Unclear information, and now we have to pay commission, when the balance runs out goodbye. What a shame !!;1;2020-12-17;15.14.1
4569;Joaquín Solís;It is outrageous that they do not inform you in advance that with the passage from e-park ("suggested" because this app is going to stop working) to essypark, it will charge you a commission when you park. You find out when you have already installed the new app. Not a word in the information on the web;1;2020-12-16;15.14.1
4570;Francisco Javier Mesa Martin;Worse clearly, e-park worked spectacularly well, clear, fast and intuitive, without taking into account that it did not charge any type of commission. Very dissatisfied with the change, once the balance that I had accumulated ends, I will switch to other applications that continue at no cost to the user. I can come to understand that it is charged for the service, but not an armed robbery as it is in this case, that they charge you for notifying you of the expiration of the ticket sends hue ...;1;2020-12-16;15.14.1
4571;Elena Baña;Horrible this app. Aside from charging commission, a robbery. I want to go back to e-park. Can be done? How i do it;1;2020-12-16;15.14.1
4572;Javier Bruk;One of the great advantages of switching from E-Park to EasyPark is that they now charge you commission ...;1;2020-12-16;15.14.1
4573;Aurora Diaz;Delighted with the application and with all the employees who attend by phone;5;2020-12-16;15.14.1
4574;Jose Torres Puente;I come from e-park, as soon as the balance ends I uninstall ..... today in a ticket of € 0.20 (the minimum) € 0.18 of "management expenses" ..... at the end it went to the machine to take out the ticket, a total of € 0.38, the "administration fees" as expensive as the ticket ........ Pd: Toni, telpark does not charge for parking in Santander (the cost is assumed by the city council per document conditions, I know what I'm talking about);1;2020-12-16;15.14.1
4575;Carito B.P.;A 10% commission with a minimum of 18 cents is outrageous. The applications practically work on their own and require few people to handle incidents. I find it embarrassing;1;2020-12-16;15.14.1
4576;Ivan Garcia;I had trouble switching from epark to this new one. And it is to admire the work of the boy who solved the problem for me on the same day. I gave it 1 star, but because of the customer service they have shown, I raise it to 5 and I will give them the opportunity to use it in the future;5;2020-12-16;15.14.1
4577;Sonia M;Little (or nothing) clear with the commissions when you change from e-park. Even if I have to pay the same, I will switch to another app.;1;2020-12-16;15.14.1
4578;Iván GM;An unintuitive interface, especially at the beginning that you have to look for the parking situation on the map so that it allows you to get the ticket from the blue zone. And if you ask for the minimum ticket (15cent x 20min) if you stop the car park by mistake (with that big button) they charge you the full amount even if a few minutes have passed.;3;2020-12-15;15.14.1
4579;Ignacio Fort;I give a star because I cannot give less. They force you to switch to easypark if you don't lose your epark balance. The first two parking lots are fine, from the third you get the surprise, which has been a hoax. Epark worked well and provided a service and now it is up to others to profit from commissions. I want my balance to be returned and I will uninstall the app. Also do not tell me to call a 911 number for payment as you do in other comments.;1;2020-12-15;15.14.1
4580;Fernando Diaz;They report Commissions after migrating !! Cheated! You put a very nice button in e-park, the account is migrated and (warning that you cannot return to the e-park account) and once the migration is done, you raise the commissions. I am going to denounce you for consumption and I am going to take the process to the end, you are not ashamed. Not that way!;1;2020-12-15;15.14.1
4581;Francisco C;They do not inform you of the commissions until you make the migration from e-park. Uninstall as soon as your balance runs out;1;2020-12-15;15.14.1
4582;Samuel Roman;Disappointing, they charge commission, do not install this application, any parking application is better.;1;2020-12-15;15.14.1
4583;Pablo makinon;Another one that comes from epark, and it seems to me that it has a very expensive commission for use, I had enough money in epark so I will use it for as long as it lasts, but if they don't lower the rate, don't count on me. I add, it is much easier to put the address by hand, and the color if it is blue or green for the app to geolocate you, they should implant it, that the car remains located the same.;1;2020-12-15;15.14.1
4584;Rafael Gamella Viñuela;Bad, very bad, with the previous one it was a pleasure. I finish the balance and change.;1;2020-12-15;15.14.1
4585;Nelly Venus Nevus;They charge you 5 euros in commissions, it's a shame, I unsubscribe and I'm going to install the competition ...;1;2020-12-15;15.14.1
4586;Sergi Tramuntana;Crap. The simplicity, usability and reliability of E-Park thrown away. If it is the same application, why do I have to re-enter my payment method and mobile number? Where is my data that E-Park had? Also now I must have the geolocation active and management costs are added. I have recommended E-Park to many people and used it often. Now with the change I will stop using EasyPark.;1;2020-12-14;15.14.1
4587;Juan Orozco;More expensive and less intuitive, for my part I will uninstall it and from now on I will pay in the park meters, it is a pity epark was very good;1;2020-12-14;15.14.1
4588;Sebastian S De La Barrera;Much worse than the previous e-park. It does not allow you to make a ticket for more than one vehicle, it is more expensive than before (in Coruña), very striking but not very practical, a nuisance and worse than before ...;1;2020-12-14;15.14.1
4589;Mado Sanchez;Much worse than e-park that was faster and easier, instead of making things easier Easypark is more complicated, less intuitive, a waste of time. I do not like. I will uninstall as soon as the balance runs out;1;2020-12-13;15.14.1
4590;laurika M;Application landmark fence, epark was much better and lighter, you did not have to look for streets or hosts, now it is all a fuss and most streets do not even leave me to park when they are in the blue zone ... and how can I see my balance ?;1;2020-12-13;15.14.1
4591;Verónica Muñoz;I will look for another app because it came from epark which was very good and between this one is worse and they charge you a lot, I do not see the grace, the truth;1;2020-12-12;15.14.1

4594;rosa del mar;They take away 2 minutes of parking, which you have paid for, of course, today he has done it to me 2 times .. With or well that e-park was going, very bad !! Edit: it happened to me again, I took screenshots, Toni, could you contact me?;1;2020-12-11;15.14.1
4595;María LE;The commission they charge is a steal € 0.18 every time you park. I do not know how the City Council allows this abuse As soon as I can uninstall it;1;2020-12-11;15.14.1
4596;Raquel F;Not counting the commissions, which with ePark there were not, of "easy" very little, it is much more confusing than epark, and also for greater inconvenience, the obligatory geolocation. As soon as the balance runs out I plan to uninstall it, a shame that ePark stops working because it was fucking great. EasyPark no. And it does not allow to return to ePark, come on, all "advantages". And answering: entering an address is another way to locate the vehicle. With ePark you only had to set the type of zone for the rate, nothing more. I'm sorry but after a week of use it seems infinitely worse, more expensive, less intuitive, more intrusive and invasive of privacy, etc. I stand by my opinion.;1;2020-12-11;15.14.1
4597;Belén Saavedra Pinto;They "promote" you to switch to the new application and everything is great and great until you install it, open it and they inform you that with the new version they charge you commission. Surprise !!! I did not use this version but the previous one was going well and its management was free. They sell you the same movie but charging;1;2020-12-10;15.14.1
4598;Dolors Alberti Quinta;A garbage, it does not warn of the fines and it is impossible to cancel them by paying. An app disaster;1;2020-12-10;15.14.1

4601;Miguel Gálvez Yubero;Very practical!!!;5;2020-12-10;15.14.1
4602;Graciela Rodriguez;The app is nefarious. It asks you for an area number that does not even correspond to the postal code, let's not talk about not knowing it. Cannot find where to recharge balance. Maybe I'm a bit stupid, but I find it totally incomprehensible. A disaster;1;2020-12-10;15.14.1

4604;Carlos H;The birds are told above that the tiket can be stopped when it is a lie. Do not migrate because it will charge you commission on all your tickets!;1;2020-12-09;15.14.1
4605;flipa flipa;In Coruña you do not pay commissions by agreement of the city council and e-patk you change the name unilaterally and with this app you try. I feel that you live thanks to the commissions. But your business is to give service to the municipal parking lot to charge them or not to sell motorcycles.;1;2020-12-08;15.14.1
4606;natalia elvira tudela;It does not allow you to access the option to choose the payment, nor does it allow you to pay once your time is up. In the end you have to go to the machine, then what is the app for?;1;2020-12-07;15.14.1
4607;Javier Sanchez;Good performance;5;2020-12-07;15.14.1
4608;Manuel Toro Legaz;I come from E park obliged and the SCAM has arrived! 10% for submitting a ticket? If you put a 25 cent ticket you pay almost 50% in commission !!! Incredible ... Never again !!!;1;2020-12-06;15.14.1
4609;Antonio Garcia;So far it works very well. Simpler and more intuitive than e-park;5;2020-12-06;15.14.1
4610;Ignacio Zornoza;I do not like it;1;2020-12-06;15.14.1

4612;Miguel Barreiro;Slower than the old epark, more uncomfortable, and with commission what was previously free. Uninstall.;1;2020-12-05;15.14.1
4613;alberto bravo;As soon as my balance is spent, I delete the app, I do not pay you a commission, enough is already paying 2 times for parking on the street (traffic tax and tickets) so that you can also charge. Thieves that is what you are.;1;2020-12-04;15.14.1
4614;Eva;They charge commission, it is much more uncomfortable than e-park and they do not notify the conditions before changing to e-park. A shame!!;1;2020-12-04;15.14.1
4615;Rafael Barroso;The fact that you have to locate yourself, I think it is not the best, although I can understand it, but the fact of paying for what you really spend on parking is amazing, I like it a lot;4;2020-12-04;15.14.1
4616;Lorien H;Not very intuitive when adding the payment method since where you must add it first, a website will appear to pay the fine. When paying for the parkmeter you must do it by location. Once the active ticket is over, you must locate where the car was to pay for another period of time, while you are already away from the car. With epark everything was easier. Preferably select the area (blue, green ...) and that's it. Remove location or that you can renew past ticket.;3;2020-12-04;15.14.1
4617;Juan Caamaño;This app crashes. The other one he has replaced was perfectly fine. Unfortunately I go back to the coins;2;2020-12-04;15.14.1
4618;Itziar Mohedano Martín;I do not like it.;1;2020-12-03;14.1.1
4619;Carlos Rodriguez;Apart from charging a 10% surcharge, the app is very bad and not very intuitive. As soon as the balance that was transferred to me from epark, which is the one I had, I will delete it.;1;2020-12-03;15.14.1

4623;Marisa López-Vallejo;Change to this mandatory app from e-park. I see a considerable rate hike. I will find another app.;1;2020-12-02;15.14.1
4624;José Luis Asensio;Commission collection. Better to pay at the parking meter.;1;2020-12-02;15.14.1
4625;José R. Vizcaíno;I don't like it at all, I'm going back to tizket, it's a shame that moving forward is this. What has cost should not be, this would have to be one more service of the city councils, that is why they charge for parking, and with an app they ensure more income. It should be a service associated with the payment of parking and included and a much better app.;1;2020-12-02;15.14.1
4626;José M. Marín;Before e-Park did not charge commission. BY forcing us to go to EasyPark, they are charging 18%. Parking cost 0.80. Commission + VAT ......., 0.18 They charge a minimum of 0.15, which indicates that if you park for less than € 1.50 the commission is disproportionate. And if I just want to park for five minutes for an errand, the fee will be over 100%. I uninstall the application. Tell me how to do for the refund of the pending amount.;1;2020-12-02;15.14.1
4627;Sonia Aguirre;I liked E-Park better. Much easier to use. This is complicated. When I tried to use it, I did not find a way to put a ticket. So I quit for artura. The geolocation to put a ticket I hate it. And doing it without it is impossible, as long as you are not sure where you are. In the end they will keep my money without being able to claim it. This application makes it more difficult for me to park than to get the ticket from the machine.;1;2020-12-02;15.13.1
4628;Maria;Lousy It must have a minimum commission, because today I parked about 10 minutes in the blue zone for 38 cents !!! I have clicked on the app to see the detail of the charge and 20 cents were for parking meter and 18 cents for commission. FLIPO. That is not the 10 ÷. It is almost 100% !!!! I park again with the street machines, unless I find another more competitive app. It is not the 10 ÷. Take a good look at the breakdown.;1;2020-12-01;15.13.1
4629;Estrella Muñoz;Nefarious. It is useless. I do not know why they have removed the park.;1;2020-12-01;15.14.1
4630;Dulce Hathor;I want to know how to delete my account, please. I am going to file a complaint for a scam in the transfer of balance from e-Park to this supposed application where there is no trace of that balance, they charge a parking surcharge, etc. Just missing. Thanks.;1;2020-12-01;15.14.1

4633;Ana Alonso;They charge you for use. But what is this?;1;2020-11-30;15.13.1
4634;Miguel Salamanca Cortina;It works worse than E-Park and adds (high) commissions for each ticket managed by the app. Don't be fooled, E-Park worked perfectly without any kind of service charge. If this app adds 'improvements', they can be charged to whoever wants them because the rest of us were happy with E-Park without commissions. Installed exclusively to exhaust my remaining balance (with Commissions !!!).;1;2020-11-30;15.13.1
4635;Rafael Gonzalez;You cannot transfer the balance of the old epark accounts to easypark because those balances were paid under conditions where no service cost was paid. Commissions cannot be charged to those balances. I do not know what criminal definition this act has at the legal level, although I am clear about what it is at the ethical level. In addition, you should notify it before making the transfer to Easy Park. Toni don't try to justify the unjustifiable;1;2020-11-30;15.13.1
4636;alfonso marijuán;Happy with e-park. Not so with easy park, they charge 10% more .... without improving the service. I will uninstall it. Does anyone know of any app, good, nice and cheap to park in Madrid ???;1;2020-11-30;15.14.1
4637;Juan M;Very expensive, it charges a 10% commission. As soon as the balance I had in e-park ends, I uninstall it. I prefer to pay from the parking meter;1;2020-11-30;15.14.1
4638;Pitiminitri Sanguijuelo;I do not receive account activation email, and it is not in spam either. However, if I get your answer to the mail. I will call them;1;2020-11-30;15.13.1
4639;Laura López;Much worse than epark, it does not limit the two hours, with what you can spend unintentionally, there is no capture or transfer ticket and it does not notify me at the end. To my bad.;1;2020-11-30;15.13.1
4640;Javier Herrero;I would like to know how I can recover my balance. I don't want to use easypark and I don't want to lose my money.;1;2020-11-30;15.13.1
4641;José Prieto;Farragosa, it tells you that you have a balance and then it seems to be another. Anyway, nothing to do with the previous epark application, especially that now you have to pay a commission.;2;2020-11-30;15.13.1
4642;Patricia Caballero;Nothing to do with the previous application, but the problems that have arisen I have been able to solve them by calling by phone, there I do have to congratulate them, for the staff that answers the calls: 10 out of 10. Messy when the application find the area where I have parked, sometimes a little exasperating.;3;2020-11-30;15.13.1
4643;Antua;Bad app and charges too much commission;1;2020-11-30;15.14.1
4644;Luz Marina Ramos Bedoya;EasyJet park. EASY?? Well, I look like a very bad application !! As for urgent parking !! Wow!! The previous one was better without so much fuss !!;1;2020-11-29;15.13.1
4645;Antonio SM;Before I had e-park if I could not charge a single euro, and now these from easypark, without prior communication (it will surely be in their fine print) charge you 10%. No more using it ... thieves, they are thieves because with the change of app they force us to, they do not warn you clearly. They are dirty.;1;2020-11-28;15.13.1
4646;Suso Vt;I just made a transfer to your account for you and I can't get into the application because of the password;1;2020-11-27;15.13.1
4647;Alberto Padilla;Can't recharge with mobile bill? The app is fatal and the penalties does not open to know if you have been fined, I can not delete my credit card ect ... I hope it improves because the old app was super good and simple;2;2020-11-27;15.13.1
4648;Javier Basalo;In A Coruña it does not detect sanctions, and therefore they cannot be annulled ... Among others it is more of a roll;1;2020-11-27;15.14.1
4649;Isabel Vicens;What a scam !!!!! In addition to charging you 10%, it does not manage the fines, that is, they put a fine on you and you have to go to the parking meter to pay. So what is this application for? With ePark it could be done. I unsubscribe immediately !!!;1;2020-11-27;15.13.1
4650;Mauri Escudero;Horrifying application. Infinitely worse than E-Park. Charging commission, which did not exist before. Enough robbery is paying to park on the street, so that they charge you commission for doing so. Repercuss the commission to the corresponding City Council or to the operating company of the service. As my balance runs out, I uninstall it.;1;2020-11-27;15.14.1
4651;Albert Sanchez Campillo;Unintuitive application, there is no list with the populations that use this app, and you do not know when to use it. And the last straw is that it has a 10% commission plus VAT. It is better to go get the ticket at the parking meter.;1;2020-11-26;15.13.1
4652;Googleador;When my SEE YOU SOON !!! balance runs out, I'm not going to pay a penny of commission.;1;2020-11-26;15.13.1
4653;Jesús G. J.;I have been forced to switch to this application. I inform those who read this that the app. Telpark, yes it is free, as was our beloved e-Park. Greetings and see you there as soon as we finish the balance.;1;2020-11-26;15.13.1
4654;gonzalo fernandez;They just called me to explain that the failure is due to the failure of the ayto servers. They have explained it to me and given me alternatives despite not being their fault. Good attention.;5;2020-11-26;15.13.1
4655;Analia Orts;Nothing intuitive and they charge for the management, and I have transferred the balance from the parking lot and it is not available in easy park.;1;2020-11-26;15.13.1
4656;Fer Bullon;THIEVES. They charge you 10% more on the ticket price. Uninstalling in 3, 2, 1 ...;1;2020-11-25;15.13.1
4657;Ainhoa;Very expensive APP. 10% of the amount it costs you to park. It is better to pay at the parking meter. I am going to use up the balance that I already had in E-Park, to cancel all the personal data that I have in this application and I will uninstall it. And do not bother to tell me that you have additional services in exchange for that money, I am neither interested nor profitable.;1;2020-11-25;15.13.1
4658;Xavier Busquets;In Girona ciutat no commission is applied, so yes!;5;2020-11-25;15.13.1
4659;José Luís Rodríguez;You do not get the amount to pay until you have done it, nor does it offer you the possibility of offering the remaining time. The previous app was better. I am in Marbella. I correct my score once the detailed gaps are fixed. Thanks for the speed in answering.;5;2020-11-25;15.13.1
4660;Aurelio Illera;My only handicap was not being able to download the tickets monthly from the application, but they have already clarified that from the web if possible. That clears my doubts. Otherwise, the application works as it should.;5;2020-11-24;15.13.1
4661;borja fernandez;With e-park I could recharge with the mobile ddl invoice and with this one, I can't, I don't like it at all;1;2020-11-24;15.13.1
4662;Jose Muñoz;App not practical and intuitive, a pity that E-Park no longer exists, it is better for you to pay at the parkmeter since it is more expensive to do it from the app, I think it is more than enough to have to pay for parking on the street, like so that they apply a commission to you. changes for the better are always welcome, when they are for the worse ...... They are not worth it;1;2020-11-23;15.13.1
4663;Roberto Fernández;Coming from e-park OBLIGATED that did the same (I do not enter to assess if the app was better or worse) WITHOUT charging any commission, I do not see an advantage to using this app. I will look for an alternative;1;2020-11-23;15.13.1
4664;Silvia Romero;This application replaces that of e-park, with a very important small change: they charge a surcharge for paying through the application. With the e-park it did not happen. I will find another or pay again at the machines on the street. I am obliged to use it if I do not want to lose the money I had in e-park;1;2020-11-23;15.13.1
4665;Luis Boto;I come from e-park and I was very badly surprised by the change in conditions and the new commissions, nothing is said until the service is transferred. It already happens to be like the others! We will test ...;1;2020-11-23;15.13.1
4666;Federico A;A real armed robbery !. I come from e-Park, which was free. Now they charge 10% of your parking spaces, but what is worse is that THE MINIMUM IS 15 CENTS. I have asked for the instant WITHDRAWAL of the service and that they RETURN my balance that I had;1;2020-11-23;15.13.1
4667;Fernando;Easy and simple, a better app than the previous one. It does justice to the name of the app.;5;2020-11-23;15.13.1
4668;Mamen Rubio Perez;It is comfortable, easy and necessary many times although you have limited time and you have to reconnect the parkmeter when time passes. Necessary notification with audible alarm would be better. Thanks;4;2020-11-23;15.13.1
4669;Jose Maria;After reading many opinions with 1 star ... I do not understand why so much trouble because this app charges a commission. It seems totally fair to me. The app works well, the time regulator is super intuitive, you activate and deactivate the time in a very simplified way. Developing this product has cost significant money, it is a service that has employees to pay, many expenses ... It is It is only fair that they try to monetize. For me a *****;5;2020-11-22;15.13.1
4670;Sara;I come from E-Park, they did not return the little balance I had in the app, I did not receive any message that they changed. I had to register in this app because it is very difficult to find parking meters in Madrid where card payment works. The app all ok. I understand that a live application of their work, but I was upset when, without having previously notified you, it appears on the ticket that they take commission, which is between 0.90-0.70 cent. I will try to always carry coins when paying.;2;2020-11-21;15.13.1
4671;jose luis sanchez de pedraza;Easy to use, very comfortable because it allows you to adjust the time as you need it.;5;2020-11-21;15.13.1
4672;Rodrigo Martin;A shame that this service has an added cost. It has gone from an application that did not charge you to this indecency;1;2020-11-20;15.13.1
4673;Isabel Maria Rodríguez Infantes;TONI has taken care of me, a very kind, patient and decisive boy. So thank you very much for his patience. With people like this it is a pleasure to contact when you have a problem.;5;2020-11-20;15.13.1
4674;Gonzalo Romero Vázquez;All perfect;5;2020-11-20;15.13.1
4675;MARIA DEL CARMEN SANTIUSTE MIGUELAÑEZ;Nefarious. I want to go back to e-park and he won't let me, you know how to do it;2;2020-11-20;15.13.1
4676;Isaac Sanchez;This application has bought other free applications that did the same and better (such as epark) to have a monopoly and charge a commission for the management, I consider that it is a very unfair tactic and I would love if no one would use it. Use epark until they reached an agreement with this company and they did not allow you to continue using it, now if you want to pay with your mobile you have to pay their commission. Anyway...;1;2020-11-19;15.13.1
4677;Ivanhoe Tosar Lopez;Horrible;1;2020-11-19;15.13.1
4678;Elena CG;Painful way to proceed. I don't like the application, because I don't want to have to provide my location every time I park, because it charges me a commission that I didn't have to pay before and because it doesn't have the option to offer / capture a ticket. But the worst has been the way to do it. They have not explained the conditions to me (it is not worth them to tell me that they are on the web or in any social network, they have sent me an SMS when they have been interested) or the opportunity to get my money back.;1;2020-11-18;15.13.1
4679;Elena Cotera Ventosa;Less intuitive than e-park and above it says that it charges a commission, 10% of the parking. The first two car parks have no commission. I'll spend the balance and uninstall it.;1;2020-11-18;15.13.1
4680;Phoenix;Does the app have a commission for parking in Madrid ??? Thank you;3;2020-11-18;15.13.1
4681;Lexi Caballero;Honestly, I join all the bad opinions about this App because it cannot be less practical and intuitive. EPark was spinning it a thousand times. To make matters worse, when they answer the phone, being a company as they say "International", they speak to you first in Catalan. Really George ?? !! At least, do it in English or give the option to choose a language ... As soon as the balance ends, I will not use it anymore. Bad user experience to say the least. Greetings!;1;2020-11-17;15.13.1
4682;Carlos N;For 16 minutes they charged me 38 ctms almost double that of e-park which worked very well. How can they have the little shame of charging those commissions in times of pandemic and crisis to the citizen? As soon as the balance runs out, I will uninstall the app. I will publish in all my networks that you have abusive prices. You have little future with those commissions, you scare the client.;1;2020-11-17;15.13.1
4683;Daniel Burgos;WRONG. So no, from a good application that worked well and fulfilled its mission to one that charges you 10% to pay ??? Uninstalling right now. If there is no other option, I will pay directly at the parking meter.;1;2020-11-17;15.13.1
4684;Beatriz García-Loygorri;I can't even open it. It is not very intuitive. I had heard bad about it and was reluctant to use it, but in the end they don't give you a choice. I have not chosen it, they have imposed it on me. Quite unhappy, really.;1;2020-11-16;15.13.1
4685;David Machero;Changes for the worse, we go from an app without commissions to charge us commission. As soon as the balance runs out, the application goes out;1;2020-11-16;15.13.1
4686;Paloma Cabrera;Be careful, e-park allowed to cancel complaints and this application did not. The first day I use it and the first fine, you don't trust a hair. I have been using e-park for more than 2 years and it was great, but the first use I make of this app and it has already stolen me. You get into payments and penalties and during the voidable period of the fine the app returns the following "We have not found cancellable complaints", then you get to the car and have the paper of the fine. I reiterate, the cancellation of fines does not work.;1;2020-11-16;15.13.1
4687;Curro Cardenas Cauqui;Of shame, in addition to paying to park, in Jerez, you have to pay 18 cents for management expenses to easypark (€ 51.84 per year if you park every day) ... completely abusive and white-collar thieves' rate. ..... epark was comfortable and at least fair, we paid to park, and that's it, that's enough;1;2020-11-15;15.13.1
4688;Manuel Rodríguez S;I migrated from e-park because I received a notification. After the transfer I was able to verify that they charge commissions. As soon as the balance is exhausted, I will cancel the app. I am aware that the other app's also charge, but at least they have not deceived me. It seems to me an intolerable induction to deception that I will not forgive.;1;2020-11-15;15.13.1
4689;R R;Much worse than e-park, and misleading. Today I wanted to park only 1 hour in Madrid, and the application has forced me to reserve for the maximum possible time, and without the possibility of recovering the excess cost. I feel cheated.;1;2020-11-15;15.13.1
4690;Derek Earley;An agile and comfortable application! Every service has a price. For the rest, there are many parking meters. My time is worth much more. Keep in that way!;5;2020-11-14;15.13.1
4691;Jesus Ito;I do not like. I changed from e-park without knowing that I had commissions at any time they say it when making the change. It would have been a detail to have made it clear from the beginning. After reading a lot of reviews all with one star, except one, I do not understand how they get that rating so high in five stars and so low in one ... Is there a catch? I will get rid of it as soon as the balance runs out, which on the other hand I have not been able to know how to recharge. Intuition = 0 Goodbye!;1;2020-11-13;15.13.1
4692;Ignacio Salafranca;I do not agree with the commission charge. € 0.47 for a parking payment of € 3.50, that is, a revolutionary tax of 13.5%. Not only do I have to pay the City Council but do I also have to consent to an additional theft? Uninstalling ... RECOMMEND: Parkinglibre DOES NOT charge commission.;1;2020-11-13;15.13.1
4693;Carlos Yague Valverde;CLARIFICATION: I valued this application with a star since it had a commission for the operation performed, and soon EasyPark contacted me and I explained that in certain cities its use does NOT have a commission. In the case of my city "Segovia" the app does not imply any cost to the end customer.;4;2020-11-13;15.13.1
4694;Al P.G.;Amazed with these people who say that e-Park was simpler 😂🤣 And others scandalized that the app charges 10%. It is seen that they must work for free;5;2020-11-13;15.13.1
4695;enrique cavada;Very good telephone service. Thanks;5;2020-11-13;15.13.1
4696;Loly Obregon;I just installed it but it can't work. It is more complicated and now it does not leave me with e-park. because??;1;2020-11-13;15.13.1
4697;ErrE WithErrE;Change the Easypark to a company for freelancers and they charge double the commission, for 30 minutes before they paid 30 cents, as a company they pay for the same time 67 cents. 30 for parking, 30 for Easypark commission and 7 for VAT. And of course at the end of the month they want to charge me another 2.30 euros of additional cost. Little thieves and liars who did not tell me this extra cost on the call. Of course I have withdrawn from the company ...;1;2020-11-12;15.13.1
4698;Maria Dolores Quintero Garcia;They are rascal. With e-park no recharge was paid. Scoundrels With me you will earn very little. I already tell you. E-park disappears, as the coins continue. Ea !! Solved;1;2020-11-12;15.13.1
4699;Irene Sierra;The worst app I have ever seen;1;2020-11-12;15.13.1
4700;Amira 84;It's an app theft. They charge you more, it doesn't work without GPS. And to top it all, once you switch the account from epark to easypark, it lets you use epark again. They are thieves, it is the only thing that matters to them, to get more money for a worse service.;1;2020-11-12;15.13.1
4701;Cristòbal Serrano;It's true. I was wrong, it is not 30%, it is more than 50%! In a 30 cent machine for half an hour, your app 48 cents, you just have to do the math Toni! It is very easy, with the mobile calculator you can do it. Scam and promoting by town halls, pathetic;1;2020-11-12;15.12.3
4702;J A B;Before with e-Park there was NO service cost. Now with the migration to Easy-Park, despite announcing that the migration has no cost, then charging YES 10% for each parking service. I don't think I'm the only one who feels DECEIVED.;1;2020-11-12;15.13.1
4703;Brb L;It is really dire. It does not explain anything about schedules or prices. The link to see if you have a penalty does not work. Anyway, very little functional. The one at e-parks was a thousand times better.;1;2020-11-11;15.12.3
4704;Tomás Bosqued;More complicated app with absurd things like the method of choosing the parking time, or having to wait for it to get GPS coverage or the hell of it having to choose where I've parked. Why do I have to share that? 😳 And what can not pay because you want where you want but only where the App says you can pay, sometimes the areas are not updated as has happened to me several times. And the last thing is that for 30 cents of parking you want to charge me 20 cts. plus. Uninstalling;1;2020-11-11;15.13.1
4705;Miguel Ángel Cano Villaverde;Armed robbery. That they force you to change an application free of charge for one with a commission of 10% .... those of the previous application are scoundrels, and those of the new application are thieves .... Why don't you try to let them people take their credit to their credit card, to see how many stay with you? ..... Is not the application so good? .... I will spend my credit and goodbye.;1;2020-11-11;15.13.1
4706;Yo mismo S;The change from e-park to easyPark represents an increase in what they have been paying for parking. For example, when I used to park for 3.20, now it costs me 3.70. 40cts may seem a pittance but with an average of 20 days that I have to park is an increase of 8 euros that I did not pay before.;1;2020-11-11;15.12.3
4707;JOSE TORRE RUIZ;Phenomenal. Yesterday I wrote a review because I could not carry out the migration and right now I have it solved, They just called me and following their instructions, I already have the application available. Perfect. Impeccable attention. Thank you.;5;2020-11-11;15.13.1
4708;Miguel Jose Becerra Carral;After using the app and seeing the comments, I see that the developers are sweating that this app is garbage. Spent all the balance, goodbye app, and they tell you that it works in Europe, like the one that is traveling all day ... Ojj pathetic and without shame that you are.;1;2020-11-11;15.13.1
4709;Bea B.;Once tested, I see that it is much worse than e-park and they also charge you commission. It is a total delay: much more cumbersome (you have to enter the address) and unclear (the active ticket is not seen as in e-park). I will use up the balance and uninstall it. So many unhappy users we can't be wrong. Answer: I know how to use it, but I still think it is worse.;1;2020-11-11;15.13.1
4710;Elena Garcia Gandara;A lousy application and on top of that they charge commission !!;1;2020-11-10;15.13.1
4711;Pedro G;Painful. Back to the coins. I do not care if the culprit is the City Council, nor do I understand that a City Council has to bear the expenses ... Hello Kate. I understand that a company is there to earn money and that you try to do it with the app. But the price is absolutely outrageous in my opinion. All the best.;1;2020-11-10;15.12.3
4712;Cucamon;I don't know how so many people do badly, my experience is very good and of quality. I've been using it for a long time and it hasn't failed me yet. It works for me inside buildings.;5;2020-11-10;15.12.3
4713;Alvaro Diaz;It is not worth the additional cost of using this app. Better to go to the parkmeter that also accepts a card and you save the commission. In addition, it charges the time you have set even if you give it to stop it before, if at least when it stops it before it charges the part consumed.;1;2020-11-09;15.13.1
4714;Anna Bayón;Do not install it - Scam ... They charge more and the change is for the worse.;1;2020-11-09;15.13.1
4715;Natalia Porras López;It is a disastrous application, I was doing very well with epark and now with this I do not even know how to recharge the account to be able to pay;1;2020-11-09;15.12.3
4716;Najia Bouzgarrou;A total backlog;1;2020-11-09;15.12.3
4717;Antonio Sotos;very useful;5;2020-11-09;15.12.3
4718;Ruben Gutierrez Burguillo;We went from not paying commissions to having to.;1;2020-11-07;15.12.3
4719;David Coperfield;Now with commissions of 0.15 minimum and without prior notice. A theft. A shame because the previous app was very good;1;2020-11-07;15.12.3
4720;David Vaquerizo;I have to use it out of obligation until I spend the balance I had in epark. You pay a 10% management fee, in short a scam. There are apps like free parking in which no commission is paid. As soon as you spend the balance GOODBYE.;1;2020-11-07;15.12.3
4721;Sergio Hoz;I give it a star because I can not give it less, I was happy with epark but they have merged with this and the application is terrible, it does not mark the time limit of the blue zone, it only works if you have GPS coverage, which is absurd because You can't pay from inside a building if you need to and it is very useful. I still have a balance but I'm still going to another application.;1;2020-11-06;15.12.3
4722;Miguel A. Del Rio;No more functionality than the previous e-park app. And with the learning that now they charge you commission. One of the reasons why I used the e-park app was precisely because they did not have a commission. Now by adding commission I will return to ElParking which allows me more things.;1;2020-11-06;15.12.3
4723;Marcial Montañés;For 5 min. Do you charge 23 cents and you get 18 commission? It seems abusive. As soon as my credit runs out, I delete it.;1;2020-11-06;15.12.3
4724;Gonzalo Llorente Benito;Theft of theft. If it is already a robbery to have to pay to park on the street, now to do it with this app an extra 10% by the face. With E-Park this did not happen and I had been using it for years, if it did not cost before I do not see why now it is. Touch to put coins again. Let's go backwards.;1;2020-11-06;15.12.3
4725;julia chica;Very complicated to use, and above all it is a robbery, do not use it, they charge you VAT every time you park. It is a robbery and above all they do not warn you, with EPARK they did not charge you, they have deceived me;1;2020-11-06;15.12.3
4726;Xisco Amunt;The change from e-park to easypark has been a lot worse. It is a complicated app and 0 intuitive. And this opinion I have contrasted with several friends who think exactly the same. The other chestnut GPS thing and the commission they take for using the service is an armed robbery. You have covered yourselves in glory!;1;2020-11-06;15.12.3
4727;Jorge CE;Shameful, I changed from epark with € 20 balance without clearly noting that the conditions changed (from having no commission to having it, and high!). That is a unilateral change of conditions without prior clear alert, for captive clients. That's how we matter to them. It is at the legal limit, but it is not ethical or fair. They should have made it possible to deplete the existing balance without commissions and indicate them when recharging. I will unsubscribe. Indicate the conditions in the description of the app! Dirty.;1;2020-11-05;15.12.3
4728;aliciacookiesglass BUZÓN MUÑOZ;Disappointed with this application, I do not see progress, on the contrary, they charge you more. I'll be back again with the coins. With E Park she was super happy. I will use this only when I do not have coins.;1;2020-11-05;15.13.1
4729;MANUEL SARMIENTO;The best solution is not to use it. Neither that nor the other. I feel robbed by the abusive commission. It is already a matter of honor in front of some insatiable and opportunistic. The Madrid city council should put its app, which is what they are for, to help the defenseless citizen.;1;2020-11-05;15.12.3
4730;Monica Velategui;I don't like it at all, and on top of that, parking is more expensive;1;2020-11-05;15.12.3
4731;Marga Baron;From. Accidentally, I changed the e-park application to this one that I think is a robbery that they charge you even if they say it is a matter of the city council. I will spend the balance that I have left and take it away. Attentive phone support but expired deeds policy is a scam;1;2020-11-05;15.12.3
4732;Alejandro Santillana;A real rubbish. Sorry to be tough but to avoid wasting your time.;1;2020-11-04;15.12.3
4733;Daniel Lozano;Well, nothing, as I still have an e-park balance, I will spend everything on a parking lot and cancel the account. I will not pay usage fees;1;2020-11-04;15.12.3
4734;ted rod;Be very careful when using the application, if the time limit is 2 hours you have to connect to "extend it" but be careful, this does not work and I was fined € 60. Thanks "EasyPark".;1;2020-11-04;15.12.3
4735;An Uskis;I value it without having used it just for the fact that now it has a cost for the service that e-park did not have. They made me change without telling me that now it would have a cost, I plan to use the money that I have loaded and goodbye. I hope to be able to spend it within the first three parking spaces and thus I do not bring you benefits. By tricksters. I understand that now the politicians have simply passed the beach bar to their buddies and it will be necessary to pay to be able to pay the parking meter. It's ridiculous.;1;2020-11-04;15.12.3
4736;Ada Pascual Blanco;With e-park that I had downloaded on my mobile, I paid for the parking of my car and that of my husband. He would call me, change the license plate of the car and pay. Now do you have to take my mobile? What a roll and on top of that 10% + vat Abusive. I will spend the balance and uninstall.;1;2020-11-04;15.13.1
4737;Agustin;I have always used epark, and when I change I find that they will charge a commission of 10%. With the times that run, easypark water. I'll find another free app, or go back to cashier payment. See you never.;1;2020-11-04;15.12.3
4738;Ruben Gonzalez;I don't understand it, epark was much better;1;2020-11-03;15.12.3
4739;Pepa Astorgano;What a robbery, they change the application and they put a 10% surcharge for using the application? No problem, we will go back to coins or other payment methods;1;2020-11-03;15.12.3
4740;Natalia Cruz Martinez;I had another application I will try this, if I pay 2 hours I can pay again without leaving the car, or do I have to change streets? What does it mean to ask for a sticker, which is sent by email;4;2020-11-03;15.12.3
4741;Javier Sáenz;Brilliant. Now to the theft of parking you have to add 10% of the APP service, a cost that is fair for the developers but that should be borne by the corresponding City Council. Thieves (municipalities, obviously).;3;2020-11-03;15.12.3
4742;Francisco Javier;I am going to spend the little balance that I have left and uninstalling the mobile. Let's go that we still have to pay the happy wave, we have to pay commission. Return to the currency and uninstalling but now.;1;2020-11-03;15.12.3
4743;carlos martin;It is a shame to have to pay for something that was not current in the e-park app and here it applies yes or yes to old users. If he used e-park, among other things, it was because it was free. Consume my balance and I will uninstall it immediately;1;2020-11-03;15.12.3
4744;Víctor;Epark worked much better. Now do you charge commission!? It seems to me A THEFT, no matter how much you reply to this message because your marketing department says it is better for the bad image you are giving.;1;2020-11-03;15.12.3
4745;Rubén Salvanés;THIEVES!!! It turns out that he used the epark to put the minimum tuckets while he left the child in the Blue Zone school for 5 minutes (cost of 5 cmt) and he did it to avoid penalties oor if any of the time passed at that precise moment. It turns out that now that same gesture costs me 20% more (10% of because it comes out of my nose plus VAT). You are scoundrels. You have already seen me as soon as you steal my remaining balance ...;1;2020-11-03;15.12.3
4746;Jess Ica;I like it and it is super easy and practical. You no longer have to run to put money back in and pay more than what you consume. It's super good;5;2020-11-02;15.12.3
4747;Ber Ferbel;Do you delete the comment for doing a simple math account? I repeat, then, they no longer need to answer. For a quick parking of 30 cents ... a surcharge of 10/15 cents is not 10%, it is a surcharge of 33/50% depending on the case. It is an abuse, gentlemen.;1;2020-11-01;15.12.3
4748;David Aguado;How can I recover my epark balance on my card / account? It seems like a robbery that they want to charge 10% for the use of a public service ... I'll put the money in the machine ...;1;2020-10-31;15.12.3
4749;Erika Silva Schaus;I don't like the time system and then the money, I don't like it.It's easier if I put the money I want to pay and know the time they give me for that money, I see it a lot, I always end up paying more;1;2020-10-28;15.12.3
4750;Vicky Garci;Painful with epark I paid from where I was without having to put the location because it does not recognize it, and I did not charge commission, I no longer use this application, with the other one it was much better, I spend the balance that I have left and uninstall it;1;2020-10-28;15.12.3
4751;Carlos Garcia;They charge you a 10% "commission", which according to them in the most expensive scenario "only" 80 cents. Desistalada and coins in the car's ashtray.;1;2020-10-28;15.12.3
4752;Victoria Rubio;I have not parked with this application yet, but at first glance the previous e-park application is much easier and more intuitive. the 10% charge for parking with a minimum of € 0.15 seems like a robbery to me. Most of my parking is 30 min € 0.30. If the aytos. They want to provide the service that they are the ones who pay for the application and its development, not the users, who already pay too much traffic taxes and not cheap time zone,;1;2020-10-28;15.12.3
4753;Tregua B;Compared to the other application, it is worth nothing, if the gps fails, I have to be looking for the name of the street to verify where I am, if something works well, I don't know why they have to change it, and to top it off, charge 10%, abusive, Of robbery;1;2020-10-27;15.12.3
4754;Luis Castro;cost for parking ?? They are clear about it, epark already tried and had to rectify why people paid at the parking meter as soon as I ran out of my old balance, ciao;1;2020-10-27;15.12.3
4755;Javi Honto;Usurers! White-collar thieves with the collusion of the administrations. Scammers and usurers, this percentage is usury and I hope you sink into misery.;1;2020-10-27;15.12.3
4756;Alejandro BG;Epark was free, I will spend the little balance that I have left and I will pay as always, a pretty dirty play.;1;2020-10-27;15.12.3
4757;Javier Jimenez Florentin;Simply very useful;5;2020-10-27;15.12.3
4758;David Canas Espinosa;The other one was better, this one is more complicated, if they continue with this they will lose many customers. He asks me for an area, I put GPS and nothing. I am locked to give it so many laps.;1;2020-10-25;15.12.3
4759;Francisco Cabal;The application did not keep the blue zone until the indicated time. I did not notice its renewal and in this case I got a fine of € 60. It is unreliable and can lead to penalties.;1;2020-10-25;15.12.3
4760;nuria merino;They force me to change applications and what happens to my old balance?;1;2020-10-24;15.12.3
4761;Alfonso Molines;It's going very well, but the only downside I see is that it doesn't have an alarm for when time runs out;3;2020-10-23;15.12.3
4762;rocio muñoz;He asks me for a zone number and I don't know it for Marbella. If it is the same application they should have migrated the data that does not stop asking me again. And the previous balance that had to happen with it? Because if they are asking me for data, they don't have it. And above all I can no longer access the old version .... In the end it has recognized an area near here and if I put it now it starts to charge me from now when you are there are not hours to pay ... I do not see balance. And you tell me to call you but you don't give me the number? ?;1;2020-10-21;15.12.3
4763;Jose Couso;I find it unfortunate that you make us change the application and on top of that you charge from the third parking lot, the other one was much easier, sorry we go;1;2020-10-21;15.12.3
4764;C. Ines Balantabares;Today I try to pay again and there is no way, he asks me for the area or address ... Please, I'm in a hurry ... It's an abuse. I will spend my 4 euros that I have balance and I delete. I prefer to carry the coins and not give commissions to an application that is fatal. E-park was phenomenal compared to this scam;1;2020-10-21;15.12.3
4765;Laura González Trujillo;Pesima Now you have to pay them commission, which with ePark not. And it won't let me use the parking button, Asking me for an area number, I don't know what it refers to ... If I want a refund of the € that I had left from the other app, how do I request it?;1;2020-10-20;15.12.3

4767;Rubén;Farragosa, complicated, it forces you to use gps otherwise you have to pinchae waypoin. Absurd and null design and functionality. Better was epark;1;2020-10-20;15.12.3
4768;José Ángel Pascual;Hands up .... They force you to go past epark. I usually park for half an hour. Almost daily. How much more is it going to cost me? 50% more. From 30 cents it goes, thanks to the Commission, to 45. Well, it doesn't seem like it. They have not considered charging 10% without minimums? In half an hour, which is the minimum time that can be paid, it would be an acceptable commission, but if you add 15 commission to 30 centimeters ...;1;2020-10-20;15.12.3
4769;INSTALACIONES ARENAS;The old one was easier to use and more comfortable, we are going to get worse. possibility of minutes only of hours everything turns into withdrawing money They had to remove all the municipalities this from the parking meters;1;2020-10-19;15.12.3
4770;Jose Piñero;For a service that before you only paid for your parking ... now you pay for parking and 10% + VAT. Theft no, the following ... Automatically uninstalled I prefer to pay in cash and not pay interest .....;1;2020-10-19;15.12.3
4771;Sergio chica alcarazo;Horrifying application: it does not detect where you are, very slow, and to cancel a fine is impossible, and it is not for the mobile, I have it on two different mobiles and the same problems on both;1;2020-10-19;15.12.3
4772;emma m;Sorry, service cost ?? Before I used e-park at no additional cost, but now it is no longer available and you have to use easy park, which charges a service cost of 10% + VAT from the fourth car park. ---- Thanks for your answer but, no matter where you look at it, it is a robbery. I can come to understand that you charge for the management, but no matter how much emoticon and service you offer, a commission of 10% + VAT is abusive .---;1;2020-10-15;15.12.3

4779;Paula LM;What is this? A tease??? It doesn't let me do anything and they force me to download it to use another app. SWINDLE!!;1;2020-09-30;15.12
4780;Isabel;You have to enter the credit card or another payment method before you can see if the city where you are is available for that application;1;2020-09-24;15.11.1
4781;MAITE VIÑAS;I had to uninstall the application because it worked .... When I reinstalled it, when I requested, in the first step, the mobile phone does not let me continue. Can you help me ?? !!! Thanks;5;2020-09-23;15.11.1
4782;Javier Moreno Solovera;A real scam, I sign up and it charges me 0'03 € without warning or permission. Obviously I have given my data so that I am charged when I request the payment of the parking not for having the app. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS SCAM. Of course I hope that the money is returned to me and even so it is planned to report this fraudulent app.;1;2020-09-19;15.11.1
4783;Jose Montoya;Fantastic, fast and EASY! I recommend using PayPal and everything is simply automatic, you only pay as long as you are, not a penny more, not one less;5;2020-09-09;15.11.1
4784;Noelia A.C;I do not like it;1;2020-09-09;15.11.1
4785;Laura Calleja;I can not be more disappointed with the App. I do not know how they have it since there are days that I have been charged double for parking and others that without parking directly decide to charge me. I hope they solve it for me because it doesn't seem like a receipt. While on vacation and I see that I have been charged what I used to put in time. I do not understand anything .... e-park does not give a problem and for new users it does not allow to use it. What a deception;1;2020-09-04;15.11.1
4786;sergio alcantara;Easy and comfortable to use. Quick to use;5;2020-09-02;15.10
4787;María García;Very good application. Useful, simple and fast. Outside parking problems. Thanks!;5;2020-09-02;15.10
4788;María Segovia;I'm going to make a claim. The worst app. Nothing reliable. I still think the same even though you are investigating, it has been better for me to rent a garage space is more, every time I use the application you charge me 18 cents per month that is a little money in the circumstances that we see each other;1;2020-09-01;15.10
4789;Elena Arranz;Neither easy, nor park. I downloaded the application because I needed to park my car THE NEXT DAY in Madrid. I was looking around to see how it worked, it lets you put the day and time you need, and there is no going back, there is no last screen to correct if there is an error in time or date or whatever, no, this application directly if you fail you pay equal. Call at 1 in the morning and they take care of you, but they have no idea how to fix it. So I had to pay for two hours that I didn't need;1;2020-08-30;15.10
4790;Eduardo Roda Teodoro;Very positive and easy to use.;5;2020-08-30;15.10
4791;Jacqueline BA;Hi there. A lousy experience. I go and download your app to see how it works last night from my house and use it tomorrow in Madrid. I enter my data and I do not know what happens that the app was caught and tells me that a place has been selected, which I did not do! . I give it to cancel and it turns out that IT DOES NOT DO ANYTHING nor does it cancel the ticket. I call his emergency number and they tell me not to worry, to cancel it and I explain that he will not let me. They write to me today and tell me that they cannot cancel it!;1;2020-08-28;15.11
4792;Derwin Pérez;I have been using another app in Malaga every day for 4 years and I have never had any problem to extend a payment or cancel a report from my mobile. Do not use this app, you will regret it, I am waiting for the complaint to arrive at my house to file a lawsuit.;1;2020-08-26;15.10
4793;Sektaria Sektaria;Easy;5;2020-08-21;15.10
4794;lente jako;It's not bad, but my credit card expired and neither the application nor the web allows me to update the expiration date or to put the same card with a different expiration date again. I take it for impossible, now I use another application. EDIT: I already tried to update the card data with the system that they tell me, and it returns me that "that card already exists" and does not allow me to save it;2;2020-08-20;15.10
4795;Irene F.;The app is fine but needs to be refined. I use it with the green zone of Tarragona and when you want to consult the sanctions it does not allow it since Tarragona does not appear on its list.;3;2020-08-19;15.10
4796;Toni Ferrer;A perfect application. Agile, friendly and effective. And the customer service is simply superb. Alicia and Edurne are exceptional, without more.;5;2020-08-18;15.10
4797;Noemí López Juan;Agile, simple and above all fair method to pay for the time you actually have your car parked. No more no less.;5;2020-08-18;15.10
4798;Elsita Lc;The truth is that it is one of the few parking apps that work very well, it already automatically indicates where you have parked, it warns you in advance when the selected time slot expires ...;5;2020-08-18;15.9
4799;v p;On vacation in Almuñécar, I park in the blue zone and pay until 12.20pm, before the time I will renew the ticket and I see that they advise doing it by downloading the application. I do it and pay, all good. I have the receipt and when I have returned to the car I have a fine of € 50. I call the customer service phone number and the solution they give me is to pay the cancellation fee. I GIVE NO CREDIT TO SO LITTLE SHAME. That later I claim. I'm sorry but I refuse to pay for your incompetence.;1;2020-08-14;15.9
4800;MARTA SERRANO IBAÑEZ;How do I get the money I have in the other application?;5;2020-08-06;15.9
4801;Esther Llin;Easy to use!!!;5;2020-07-29;15.9
4802;Guillermo CC;The application has a confusing design. You cannot cancel a car park and worst of all, it does not require confirmation to reserve it. Very unhappy;1;2020-07-28;15.9
4803;Marga Ramirez;The truth is very comfortable, no problem. Maybe a few more cents but it is worth it for the convenience of being able to extend the times. Very happy;4;2020-07-28;15.9
4804;Teo Lopez;They charge you (like all these apps) about € 0.2 more per hour than paying at the machine at the foot of the parking lot;3;2020-07-26;15.9
4805;Cristina Digon;Fatal, I put the ticket at 11:25 am and a fine at 11:29 am Total distrust And above all, I have to manage the fine to claim they don't know anything 😡🤬;1;2020-07-23;15.9

4807;Svensk Smith;Does not work on Android 10/oxygen os;1;2020-07-20;15.9
4808;Antonio Blazquez;I find the Easypark Service charge a THEFT. If I have to make 3 payments a day (to be able to park at my beach house) they are € 0.60 / day. I go 20 days and they represent € 12 of the easypark service. I have always done it with E-Park that does not charge commission.;1;2020-07-19;15.9
4809;Lucia Merino;It does not notify you of the allowed parking time limit. I do not recommend it;1;2020-07-18;15.9
4810;salvador Listán Galán;You should charge for the exact time that the vehicle is parked ... start of duration and end of parking button and this is the amount. Not that if you leave before you lose money.;2;2020-07-16;15.9
4811;Carlos Heredia;What a residue of application, it does not return the money if you are less time than the time you have indicated when parking, you are a lot of thieves and above all, you should be ashamed of having put this application residue to park and pay on the beaches ..... Each and every one of your dead !!!;1;2020-07-15;15.9
4812;Carlos GE;Personally, I do not understand or share that you have to charge the citizen (who already pays road tax and above all the blue zone). You should charge the concessionaire, like bank cards or insurance brokers do. As long as this continues, I will only use the application in emergencies (do not carry any money in your pocket).;1;2020-07-15;15.9
4813;Cailon 04;One pu m all b. Very difficult and I shit on it, do not discard this app i VISCA CATALUÑA;1;2020-07-11;15.9
4814;Javier Mateo;The app works quite strange and confusing. It seems that if you want to extend a 5 minute ticket, it charges you a supplement for each extension. also at night I like to put in 1 more minute and that the ticket lasts until 9 o'clock the next day and for that extra minute they have charged me 6 euros more (in the parkimeter it costs 1 cent). In the end, I paid 7 euros to park for an hour and a half in the blue zone. First and last time I use it;1;2020-07-09;15.8

4820;Miguel Mora Cuesta;My experience is in the parking meters of Tarragona. This application charges them 15% more expensive just because. If the city council offers 4 apps to make the payment, all the others cost the same as in the parking meter, except this one. And in the midst of the coronavirus crisis, it seems irresponsible to me. The business model of "if it sneaks, sneaks".;1;2020-05-21;15.5.1
4821;Antonio López;It has saved me a lot of fines. Super comfortable. And I don't spend a penny too much.;5;2020-03-20;15.3
4822;Jose Antonio Panadero Morcillo;!! You have the option of giving your car a maximum of two more hours without having to go there, it is something fantastic without spoiling that moment before ALWAYS inopportune !!.;5;2020-03-17;15.1
4823;Juan;It makes it easier for me to control parking in my town.;5;2020-03-11;15.2

4825;Antonio;It works well and fast.;5;2020-03-03;15.0
4826;Alberto Gallegos;Very bad application, I have been fined for trusting this app. When I contacted them, they only replied that it is the fault of the GPS. It cannot be trusted after this I recommend not using this app since they are not responsible for failures ... I recommend paying at the machines is safer and they will invite the displeasure of seeing a ticket on their windshield ... Since They will hold you responsible and do not take care of the position errors that your application sends ...;1;2020-02-25;15.0
4827;Gema Medina Lopez;It does not take into account the timetables of the zones. It charges you from the moment you start the ticket even if it is outside of the parking hours. A fraud.;1;2020-02-24;15.0
4828;Un usuario de Google;Very useful app, fast and the exactly cost by minutes BUT the payment with card has to be fixed, it takes days until the user gets charged by, normally I block my cards as protection for being used online and I open it when I wanna use it online, I can't leave it opened online for days until easypark wants to charge me, please fix that the user gets charged right way when paying with card cause most of the people knows that can be hacked with a card open to use online.;3;2020-02-12;14.9.1
4829;felipe toledo;The application is not bad, easy to use, what I like the most is that they charge just the time you are parked, it has a but important to me, they charge you for sending you an email with the information of the time and amount you have been, but that mail never arrives.;3;2020-02-03;14.1.1
4830;Julian Haro Muela;Very bad, you pay double for the same time as if you get a ticket, it is not worth doing it from the application ...;1;2020-01-29;14.9

4835;FERNANDO collado toboso;Good;4;2019-12-28;14.6.1
4836;Sergi M.;Quite good, although when the parking time runs out, I would like to extend the stay, but the application shows a summary of the parking lot, and starts a new parking lot where the mobile is, not the car. And you have to start a new car park again, taking the locator by hand where the car is parked, and then the application says that the place is not recognized ...... And before yes? I hope for good improvements.;2;2019-12-24;14.5.1
4837;Eduardo Galan;I did not expect to have to put the estimated time and then have to pay the minimum time again ... in this way I have paid more expensive for the blue zone, the difference in price for parking 5 more minutes in a row. It is also cheaper to pay with coins than with EasyParrk, I imagine it will be commission. The normal and fair thing would be to stop the parking time when you get to the car and pay for the minutes parked and not twice the minimum;1;2019-12-23;14.6.1
4838;Naty Huertas;I park at 9:30 a.m. they give me a fine at 10:40 a.m. I get the ticket at 10:00 until 12:30 a.m. they charge me and they don't tell me that they had already given me a fine, now I have a fine of € 90 plus the price of the parkimeter;1;2019-12-21;14.6.1
4839;Duncan Zauss;The app didn't work and we had to pay a fine. Easypark reimbursed the parking fee after complaining, but the fine was of course much higher.;1;2019-12-10;14.6
4840;Victoria Romero;Well, bad Madrid. While parked in the blue zone, he applied green zone rates to me and the time he allowed me to stay in the square was the green zone. The same street had a blue and green zone and he did not detect it.;2;2019-12-05;14.5.1

4846;Antonio Cirio;I could not pay for the app I was in a restaurant and I had to go out 2 times to pay at the cashier. What a botch application !!!;1;2019-10-12;14.2
4847;Juan Jose Garcia;In my town this service represents a cost of € 0.19 for each use, apart from parking fees. In most cases it is more worth the ticket;1;2019-10-01;14.1.1

4852;Pakito GG;What I said fulfilled my 5 stars, over time they updated to pay fines from the app, so few problems can be put. As a complicated improvement but that would be very helpful is a free zone finder indicating the position of it, I know that it is a bit complex to do but it would be a +1000 to avoid those eternal searches without knowing where to park;5;2019-08-09;13.8
4853;Carmen García;It doesn't work, once the app is downloaded it stops unexpectedly and you can't access it.;1;2019-08-08;13.7.1

4855;Mari Carmen;I think it would be interesting if it had integration with android auto so that you can start parking from the car screen.;4;2019-08-06;13.7.1

4857;Cristina Garcia;unsatisfactory experience, you select the time you think you will be and if you return beforehand, it also charges you the total amount.;1;2019-06-25;13.4.1
4858;Gabriel Escribano;The two stars is for allowing the City Council to allow you to not be able to interrupt the parking lot before the set time at the beginning it was possible, which shows the tax collection effort of the blue zones and not only regulating parking.;2;2019-06-18;13.4

4863;Francisco Mediano Villanueva;Before, when it allowed you to stop the parking lot and did not charge you the rest of the time, it compensated. what you paid more with the commission you saved with that return. In any case, that does not depend on the developers of the app, which is reliable and comfortable to use.;4;2019-05-17;13.2

4870;Un usuario de Google;At the moment I have only used it once for a sporadic trip to Albacete and by chance that I was not loose, I have to say that it surprised me for good in a couple of minutes downloaded, installed, working and payment by card. I don't usually use a lot of blue area but I leave the application installed just in case and seeing other comments I hope you continue working to improve it, although in my case I am very satisfied.;5;2019-03-29;12.7

4874;Pedro Sánchez Escamilla;So far it works fine. I would score more if the system charged at the times indicated by the parkmeter. If I want to put the parking meter at 2:30 p.m. for example and the prayer starts at 4:30 p.m., I should start charging from 4:30 p.m. and not before. Other apps work with the time of the parkmeter. Good things I see, you do not have to leave money on deposit. Each payment is a collection. You can assign the zone with a code and forget about the street. Keep improving.

4909;Raquel Lara;It is very good except for the fact that you have to be aware if they are long parking lots, they should let you put the time you need is so you do not have to be aware of the mobile either;3;2018-10-17;11.6.1
4910;Jaco xperia;€ 4'65 for 56 minutes of parking. Some scammers. Do not use it! They do not indicate the cost of parking or indicate how much they are charging you, you are surprised later.;1;2018-10-05;11.5.1

4916;Ciber Despacio;It's a scam, they hook advertising papers on the machines when the real application of the generalitat is apparkb. Do not allow unsubscribe from the app and also does not allow you to delete the payment method. If they don't make you case: create a fake PayPal account and associate it, that will remove the card as a payment method. Then you delete the PayPal account and it stays there. (I It seems illogical that to unsubscribe they ask you for personal information, when to register are not mandatory). Never give personal data to Companies like these, who want to know everything about you and the service is precarious.;1;2018-08-02;11.1.2

4920;El rincón del relax;This app is the worst. Rather the gentlemen of granting sea ​​award. I put a voucher that costs 5.10e and they charge me 5.85e for the face. Then if I pay by the hour, which is supposed to be cheaper, I get an arm and a leg parking lot. And if I leave before the time I have paid I can't stop the timer. Is a fraud in every rule.;1;2018-07-24;11.1.2

4922;gladiador maximo;An app scam. If you spend time and they report you, it does not notify you. You just keep throwing more money despite being reported. The price that you pay does not correspond to the one in the blue zone. Is superior. Has problems with location. It does not allow paying complaints. A big mistake since you pay more on;1;2018-07-19;10.7.2

4935;José María Sánchez;I like how it works. It is easy and accurate. Customer service works promptly and courteously. The only downside that I find today is that it consumes the battery in an exaggerated way and I have verified that it is due to the application and not for another reason. I hope they solve this problem and I will be happy to give the highest marks.;4;2018-03-20;10.6.1

4941;Christian Lange;You cannot unsubscribe a payment method or unsubscribe from the app. In the 21st century this is not acceptable. When it comes to registering, everything is easy, but unsubscribing is another matter. Contact customer service for this ??? Really??? I only ask for the same ease to unsubscribe as when registering. This way of working reminds me of the worst of the telecos in their darkest years. Charging 15% for the service are they not able to offer this ??? The apps are made to save time and not to waste it. I will only contact customer service and I will waste my time to cancel the payment method and to unsubscribe from the app. I do not recommend it at all and as soon as I cancel my personal data I will remove it from the phone.;1;2018-01-06;10.4.2
4942;Un usuario de Google;I like it and it's very easy;4;2017-12-21;5.9.2
4943;Xavier Alabart;It is perfect for parking in the blue zone and being able to forget about taking the ticket. Wherever you are, you renew the parking lot. Also, if you don't consume all the time, you finish and only pay for what you actually consume. The only downside is that the notifications do not go down pat but otherwise a great app.;5;2017-12-19;5.9.2

4948;monica rodriguez;I parked on June 9 and when I got back to the car before the end of time I had a fine as if the guard had not detected it. I made the claim in the Sant Joan Despi town hall with all the damage to the mobilization that it caused me, since I do not live there. Provide the ticket to show that I paid. Today, October 25, they call me and tell me that easypark is not authorized to cover the blue zone in Sant Joan Despi !! How is it possible??;2;2017-10-25;5.9.2

4952;Enrique Sanchez Gonzalez;I used it in Mérida but it turns out that for 3 months it is no longer valid according to the controller of the area and the app continues to allow you to use it. Please update when it is no longer valid. I hope they don't charge me for something that was useless;1;2017-07-31;5.8.9
4953;Verónica G M;Today I installed and paid through PayPal, I do not see the payment in the account, or in the PayPal How long does it take to make the payment effective ??? I hope I don't have any problems.;2;2017-07-23;5.8.9
4954;PEDRO ROVIRA;I have changed from Mobile to a better one, and now this app does not work for me, why?;1;2017-07-22;5.8.9
4955;Fernando Sánchez;Very practical, and although the rate is more expensive, in practice it is much cheaper ... How many times, for not having coins or not knowing the time we need, do we put in one or two euros? Logically we have lost it? And how many times have we been fined or have we been exposed to a fine because we have run out of money? Love it.;5;2017-06-26;5.8.8
4956;Manuel Berbesi;Practical, but parking is practically twice the price of using the parking meter, there should be a list with the rates you charge, also removing personal data and deleting the account does not appear anywhere.;3;2017-06-19;5.8.7
4957;Alberto Gn;It doesn't matter that you use it, you get fined and it's more expensive;1;2017-05-23;5.6
4958;Juan García Beamud;I'm going to give him 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 because the truth is that he deserves it. It is simple, intuitive and does exactly what it says. Very comfortable payment with it. The bad thing is its integration with the municipalities, since, for example, with Alicante capital, it has no integration.;5;2017-04-11;5.8.4
4959;Javier Sanchis;Why not be able to park several vehicles from my mobile at the same time?;5;2017-04-10;5.8.5
4960;Ana Isabel;The application works well, what happens is that for the same time, 15min, they have charged me twice as much as if I had done it from the parking meter;2;2017-04-04;5.8.4
4961;Conchi;I have sent two friends sms for the 5 euros bonus and they have given it to them and not to me, it seems like a fool.;3;2017-04-04;5.8.4
4962;Noemi SG;Less hype in the description, we have so many votes and awards ... And more useful information. I have not been able to find in the description a list with the cities, at least in Spain, in which it works, you enter the app and to begin, before you can see if you are interested in having it, it already asks for the phone number. Well it goes, you agree and there is not even a list of cities in which this app works. You can just go to the map put it somewhere and wait for it to tell you if it goes or not. I work all over the province and the truth is, having to move the "cursor" all over the map to see in which cities I visit I can use it, it doesn't seem too useful to me. Of course I uninstall it, since I have looked at 2 or 3 cities and "it was not available in that area". I can't look at all of them. You should put in a clear and visible place before downloading the app the list of available cities. To be able to check if it is going to be useful to you before you have to download it and provide your phone number to continue without knowing where it works and where it does not.;1;2017-03-14;5.8.4
4963;Miguel Angel Carbayo;Very practical and comfortable, you don't have to look for the ticket dispenser and go to the car and put it on. It alerts you if the time is up and you recharge it wherever you are. I recommend it.;5;2017-03-12;5.8.4
4964;Ignacio Acosta;I live in Barcelona in the code 08014 and the program tells me that it doesn't exist, hahaha, how bad it is.;1;2017-02-24;5.8.4
4965;Yurizan Ocana;This application is very comfortable. Thanks!;5;2017-02-11;5.8.4
4966;Teresa Hernández Valiente;I honestly love it. It is very convenient to use your mobile instead of having to go to the parking meter, having made sure you have loose money and having to return to the car to leave the piece of paper. Thanks EasyPark!;5;2017-01-18;5.8.4
4967;Rogers González;In a parking lot close to home I pay 40 crowns for 24 hours. And with the app they charge me the same 40 for 15 hours. I do not think it's fair.;1;2017-01-17;5.8.3

4972;Eladio Molina Jara;I have been charged without confirming the service. He had also gotten a ticket from the vending machine. How can I claim a refund of what I have been charged?;1;2016-12-14;5.8.2
4973;Pablo Suarez Fernandez-Miranda;Today is a holiday and it is also 8:10 p.m. However, the thread of time marks as if it were to buy time for now instead of starting tomorrow at 9am, which would be when regulated parking begins. This generates a lot of mistrust in the app since I cannot know if tomorrow I will be covered or not ...;2;2016-12-06;5.8.2

4979;Milenko Halat;As the sticker is on the meter, you assume that it is a form of payment for the service. They do not warn you that they charge 10% until you have already inserted your credit card it is too late. It made me feel awful. It lets you set the time you want, and then say "ah, this is only 2 hrs." -》 design problem. A crush when pressing the notification. The fine to cancel did not appear ...;1;2016-10-07;5.7.1

4986;Miguel LM;I renewed my expired parking ticket at 6:41 PM and I was fined at 6:41 PM, what a coincidence! Was the controller waiting or is it that with this app they have us so controlled that the fines are generated automatically? I will not use it anymore. I do not trust.;1;2016-07-25;5.6
4987;Jonathan Moreno;Or else I can't find it. Taking into account that you put very sensitive data, this is a big problem. EDIT: I upgrade to 3 stars for the fact that the attention via e-mail is satisfactory. However, I think that the unsubscribe option should be integrated into the app.;3;2016-07-22;5.5
4988;Un usuario de Google;The truth is that I have recently used it but I love it. My mobile is slow and that complicates it a bit, but you save by paying only what you use and not be looking for loose .. in short, it can be improved;5;2016-06-28;5.5
4989;Isabel carmona perez;very good;5;2016-06-18;5.5
4990;Javier Martín González;You should pay what you spend and not have to put a time. So there was a counter from 0 until you got to the car. Because if I put 10 minutes and it takes 5, I pay for 10. Very bad. The app park in barcelona is much better for that;1;2016-05-11;5.1
4991;Franc Javier;If I go to the meter with 30 cents, I have more time than paying from the app for the same minutes. Proven ... neither for parking lots of several minutes nor for a few minutes. it doesn't pay off. Sometimes the app screen disappears and you don't know if the indicated time has ended or not or if the payment has been made correctly ... I am a resident and I am definitely going to uninstall it. When there is an app developed by the same company or city council, I think about it. Thanks for everything!;1;2016-05-10;5.3
4992;Alex Felipe;I had everything activated and now I get a different number from mine on the home screen. If I give it to recover password, the SMS does not arrive, because the number that comes out is from a landline. And if I try to change that number and it lets me put password. . So I get out and everything starts again. It was very useful to me but now it is a waste of time. Today April 27, I re-register and now it says that PayPal registration fails. A painful application. I still do not change my opinion.;1;2016-04-27;5.4.1

5038;Flortxu;A scam, do not migrate from the app because this new one is much more expensive and works worse. I just checked to put a ticket with my boy, using this myself and my boy E-park and the difference is abysmal. His rate was 0.4 so he applied 0.58 to me ... 50% more! Also here the minimum is not 5cts as in the rest of the app, they charge you a minimum of 30cts. Logically I have uninstalled this app and looked for an alternative because it no longer lets me go back to EPark. Be careful, do not change!;1;2021-03-29;15.18.1
5039;Apgonza;Compared to e-park, an m *. Forces to use GPS. Or you memorize the area codes of the cities. If you are not attentive to turning the wheel, you touch and you have already paid the minimum. I have paid 30 cts 2 times for one minute each time. It does not ask for confirmation. In Coruña the payment is until 20 and with ePark it jumped the next day. With this no, you can pay until 12 at night if you want. This is not for users, it is for experts.

It also gives you the license plates, but not the car model ... now to know what vehicle each one is ... I honestly think ePark is much better, it is a change to charge a commission for parking ... if not ... I can't find the sense;2;2021-03-22;15.18.1

Long stay, which they take for granted that we know what color is to top it off, you select a parking lot by geolocation, it does not facilitate anything, thanks to this application and how bad it is, I have paid for my parking and on top of that I take a complaint and they wash their hands. You call and after talking when you ask for the information to report they hang up the phone, a man named Emanuel. Legal measures will be taken in this regard. Because it's a shame. Enough already.

5067;claves ocupada;It has already happened to me twice, the application's GPS fails and I say about the application because I have GPS in other applications and it has never happened to me. The application locates you, you put the time slot, they charge you and you leave calm of having done things well and when you return you have a fine of € 60 because it says that that area where you have parked does not correspond to the ticket you have paid! !! You make an appointment on Calle Albarracin, you go with the official who does not look at you, only suspects, you show him the ticket you put in the application, the money that was collected and the fine that you had on the dashboard of your car. The ticket and fine schedule coincide, and the official says that it is not his problem, that my GPS is wrong (it will be the one in your application, right?), In any case it is seen that it is an error and that there are no bad intentions. The ticket is paid, at the time where I have been fined saying that I am fined for not having a ticket. The civil servant rejoices in his seat and says that I learn the areas, and that it is of no use to me, neither my tests nor having wasted my time, nor the money I paid in the area where I erroneously located your application. That the fine remains. Obviously the tax collection effort has no end. Do not use the application but you want to lose € 60 and on top of it put up with a man who in addition to having little empathy enjoys knowing that he is cheating on you. Ser parking + application = insured ticket Do not use it.;1;2021-09-24;15.27.1

5082;Multa y sanción;It does not meet the objective. Despite having taken out the corresponding tickets, the information was not transmitted to the Madrid community system and they imposed a fine.

The first time I used it, I mistakenly canceled a payment of € 1.3 within seconds of making it. The solution: pay 1.3 € again. I said, a garbage infects application. By the way, I don't live in Madrid. I live in Coruña. And once you give it to cancel, the solution so that you don't get fined is to pay again. I said, an application scam. For my part, now I pay in cash. Hopefully with that I collaborate so that this garbage is loaded;1;2021-08-30;15.26.0

In general I liked it better before the merger with easypark.;1;2021-08-20;15.25.0

5109;Vicentbf;I pay for an hour, that's how it comes out in the apple pay payment, and the application modifies it and then puts it half an hour with which I receive a fine of € 60. I complain to them and they tell me that I have canceled the parking lot and I have reduced it to half an hour alone. I tell them that this is a failure of their application, because I have not modified anything and they tell me that they cannot do anything. Now they tell me that I stopped the parking time, I remember entering to see the time and the application told me that it had an active parking, but it did not notify me that it had stopped it and had become inactive. Come on, not a confirmation message. The aforementioned needs to put a confirmation message to avoid errors and above all to notify you correctly. Totally I have to pay € 60 and you know that this app is useless until it is modified.;1;2021-07-21;15.24.0
5110;pkwlsk;I was forced to switch from ePark to EasyPark not voluntarily, but because it was the only option. I don't like EasyPark at all, and to top it all it's much more expensive. With ePark I was able to park as little as possible to park for a very short period of time, which was sometimes more than enough for me. Here the minimum is almost double the price of ePark and every time I select a time it gives me more time (charging me, of course) without me asking for it (two or three minutes, unnecessary most of the time). For me, it's just… regrettable. Hopefully I can go back to ePark.;1;2021-07-17;15.24.0

5112;Mihai_dmc;Spanish app doesn’t allow you to put money in a local wallet so you get charget an extra 15 cents each time you pay for parking. Interface is really bad, doesn’t allow you to select an amount but you have to spin the wheel until you’re satisfied and hope not to press “start parking” while doing that. Worse of all it doesn’t take into account free parking hours making you pay when you shouldn’t. Even worse, there’s no alternative to this app.  At least the devs/pr answer to all reviews, but that doesn’t make the app any better... imagine having to defend such a bad app lol, you should get paid better!;1;2021-07-16;15.24.0
5113;El Manco Fullero;A shame that the city council allows third parties to charge a commission, an application focused on plucking the driver, take care that the parking lot has ended because you can get a surprise. Uninstalling 1, 2, 3, NOW !!!;1;2021-07-15;15.24.0
5114;Shoppinglist;They forced me to download the application from e-park, which has stopped working because it must have been absorbed by this other brand with more presence in other cities. At first I did not care, until I started using the application. What a disaster! Not only does it not recognize the time slots that are not paid, but it also does not allow you to extend active tickets, two essential features for this kind of service. As soon as the credit that was automatically transferred from e-park ends (without giving me the option to recover it in another way) I leave this botch, which in view of the change in conditions in the terms of use could be considered a scam.;1;2021-07-15;15.24.0
5115;Graciela Dávila;The application is very cute and what I like the most is that I needed help and I called only once and the attention was wonderful, I give them 100 points out of 100 😁 for being kind, decisive and willing to help you. I recommend the application, I love it !!!;5;2021-07-02;15.23.0
5116;marylingling;The design of the application is so confusing that it is not clear if you have put the ticket or not. They do not warn if your parking is going to end. It is difficult to find the ticket, the same screen of the wheel always appears (which apart is difficult to handle). I was fined for his fault because I thought I had put the ticket and it seems that I did not put it, all because of the bad design and poor visibility. The same thing happened to two friends. I wrote an email to the application and they did not bother to answer. I will not use it again, you risk a fine !!!;1;2021-07-15;15.24.0
5117;Telas;Honestly much better and simple the old e-park. Things that have gotten worse: Now the cost of parking is updated once you pay, so the cost and duration are not at all clear at the beginning The car models no longer load them automatically The roulette is a bit uncomfortable for my like Better things: Being able to finish the parking lot sooner Visually a little more beautiful;2;2021-07-15;15.24.0
5118;CHORICEO;Very bad performance, not well understood;1;2021-07-08;15.23.0
5119;Mrymsmar;I had the other app (ePark) and I was happy with it. With the change, everything has been for the worse. Apart from the higher prices, the gigantic button where the time is chosen is badly thought out. You have to turn the wheel to mark the time and one millimeter away is the "Start Parking" button, so it is extremely easy to hit it by mistake. And if you have fallen short, great, but if you spend time, because you were still adjusting it, too bad. To overpay. Furthermore, in Madrid you cannot stop parking. So, you hang on and EasyPark wins a little more with your mistake. I want to think that this button is badly designed and not done with all the intention. Either way, as soon as my balance runs out, you won't see me again.;1;2021-07-07;15.23.0
5120;AAMBC23;Impossible to extend a parking lot. You need to search the area again and create a new parking lot. There is no transparency in the rates applied.;1;2021-07-03;15.23.0
5121;trgdegg;I said, it occurred to me to hit the HUGE button to STOP after paying 7 euros for parking, and I find out from third parties, because the app does not warn you that your car is not covered, although it puts you in its corresponding section that you have a ticket active. They say it is that in Madrid and Lorca it cannot be done because the ordinance does not allow it, so disable the STOP button or return the money in those sites CARADURAS. On top of that, you are so shameless not to warn you and CHEAT by showing an active ticket message, so if I don't find out in time, on top of it Fine. I just had a balance, and I happened to introduce my bank card in this scam. I just balance, uninstall and to something else.;1;2021-07-03;15.23.0
5122;Javitooooooooooo;€ 10 per month for a company account to be able to manage more than one vehicle simultaneously (if not, it cannot be done) An application that worked like a charm like e-park has been loaded to create this. Congratulations, you already have one less business client.   Please do not lie to me because I have spoken with your telephone service and they have told me that it is € 10 per month. I give them a few months until they go bankrupt.;1;2021-07-02;15.23.0
5123;Xurxo13;E-park users were forced to change applications with threats of taking away the money we had in prepayment and without warning that with the new application there is a minimum surcharge of 10%. Except for emergencies, I will use the park meters again.;1;2021-07-02;15.23.0
5124;Trezene;The old app was much better, easier to use, without the possibility of activating anything that you did not want!  Now, when you hit the wheel to choose the time, you have to be very fine because you still haven't set the parking time you need, but accidentally when you turn you give it to start. Which is right in the center ... the same thing happens to cancel, you can do it without wanting to!  It would not be bad if I asked you for CONFIRMATION before either of those two actions. Or they put the buttons elsewhere, or a less complicated system than turning the wheel to select the duration of your parking ... Anything I can think of is better than this.  In my city the blue zone ends at 9:00 p.m., but the app allows you to pay all night .....  To top it off, prices have risen ... I'm afraid I'm going back to coins! Easier and cheaper;2;2021-07-02;15.23.0
5125;Susobxl;I was forced to switch to this new app from E-Park and it is much worse for my liking. I can't expand the parking lot once started (sure there is a way but they certainly haven't made it easy since I can't find it). A real hassle. It is not easily found, although it is, the car parks in progress. In addition, it does not indicate the time at which it is no longer necessary to pay (in other applications it jumps directly to the next day) which leads to confusion. And to pay the next day you have to hit the wheel absurdly. Too bad that e-park is no longer there. It was clear and simple.;2;2021-06-24;15.23.0
5126;Pplar;I don't like it at all, with the old E-park app I could remotely check if my car had been fined when I had missed parking by mistake. This option does not exist now and if you do not go to the car to see it, it is impossible to know if you have been fined or not;1;2021-07-01;15.23.0
5127;DMP98;You are a bunch of cheeks, you don't let me pay in cash at the parkmeter, and the very advertising of your app says "save money" and you are charging me 0.44 cents of VAT. You are scavengers.;1;2021-06-27;15.23.0
5128;Agmzxz;Now parking is more expensive, it is charged for everything from the procedures to the alerts and the tool is not intuitive. Very bad app;1;2021-06-25;15.23.0
5129;Lauritamarbella;It says that E-Park is now Easy park, but the reality is that with E-park you paid the official rate and with Easy Park you get an additional surcharge to the rate you would pay at the ticket vending machine. It is also not very transparent in this aspect and it does not warn you that you are paying the same for 15 minutes as for 30 minutes, to allow you to mark the maximum time you have for what you pay. Of course they have eliminated the sharing of the ticket. They are going to earn money, not to facilitate the obligatory payment of Parkimetro like the other apps. The best is Telpark.;2;2021-06-19;15.22.0
5130;mariagdp;Not intuitive, much time wasted, and more expensive. With ePark everything was much easier, the change has been for the worse.;1;2021-06-23;15.22.0
5131;Corsarius24;They charge an exaggerated minimum commission, compared to other parking meter apps that charge only the corresponding percentage. In addition, it is easier for me to use other similar apps. I do not want it;1;2021-06-23;15.22.0

5135;AlmaRoma32;I have been using the app for a short time but in principle it seems practical, easy and agile. Customer service is very good. I had an incident and they called me very quickly to solve it. Recommendable!!;5;2021-05-28;15.21.0
5136;martams79;Slow, confusing and not very practical, they have given me two fines for bad usability of the application, switch to e-park again, this is crap and the Girona city council are usurers without empathy, one thing is to do business in the city and the other is to take advantage 😡;1;2021-06-18;15.22.0
5137;Grks33;They do not comply with the stipulated rates and they take 18 cent. Every time you put a ticket. When supposedly they weren't going to do it. And then the function of looking at the fines is useless. It always says you don't have. Let E-Park come back !!!;1;2021-06-18;15.22.0
5138;74cesar74;I don't know who made the design, but the usability is very bad;1;2021-06-17;15.22.0
5139;Hpt789;The parking lot does not take into account the time of the zone (Paying for unnecessary minutes) The different parking groups (green, red or orange zone) do not explain them to you, neither the time nor the color to which it corresponds, in addition, it is incorrectly configured (at least the short-lived zone)! It makes me very pissed off. It works too badly when the previous app to park in Coruña worked well.;1;2021-06-15;15.22.0
5140;Roberto@1980;It is one of the worst apps that I know, you are adjusting the parking time and as you move 1 mm it issues the payment because the central button is the payment button and there is no prior confirmation. honestly one of the worst apps I know if I could I deleted it  Greetings;1;2021-06-15;15.22.0

5144;Sergiopuntoes;You cannot remove fines or view them in the App, it redirects you to its website that is in another language, and that when it works. You cannot eliminate fines if you are connected to a wifi and I repeat, when the service works. They have given me three tickets that I did not see in the App and I had them in the car. A ruin !!!!;1;2021-06-10;15.22.0

5148;Miguelms67;Let E-Park come back !!!!! It was super easy !!!! To leave paid the next day, the application already began to count from 10:00 in the morning, the start time of regulated parking.  This one, you turn the happy little wheel, And you go by all the hours of the morning and you see how the money in euros continues to add up.  By God it is impossible to make it worse;1;2021-06-08;15.22.0
5149;DanCasRom;The UX is a far cry from the previous E-park app. The click to action for the payment method is terrible, instead of putting the Time and Payment selector apart, they put both on a wheel and the one that your finger goes slightly, they charge you without prior confirmation, the time marked in that moment by the wheel, so that you cannot verify if it is correct or not, nor cancel the payment.  I feel cheated!! Exactly that has happened to me, not being able to cancel the parking made by mistake, because there is no button for it, I wrote an email to the customer service email, telling them what happened and attaching data and a screenshot. They have called me by phone (which I appreciate), and the answer is that "in Madrid they cannot cancel or cancel errors, because the city council does not allow them that option."  I understand that the city council can set some rules, but if so, then EasyPark should change the current design of the payment mode (at least in Madrid, put separate buttons for selecting time and payment) so that it is not so easy to make the mistake to pay for a parking that you do not want to do or for the unwanted time. Otherwise, it will seem that they want to take advantage of all those charges committed by mistake.  I will report both the app and the city council to the consumer office, because I honestly think it is a real scam towards users and customers.  Of course, I do not recommend anyone to use this app, at least as long as they do not change the payment method.;1;2021-06-07;15.22.0

5152;gyyna 33;I used e-park and was delighted. It forced me to change and what a bad app. He does not ask for confirmation, I accidentally hit the wheel and for a second they have charged me 20 cents. I'm going to uninstall it right now. With the previous one you loaded money and you had your balance. Now I think they group the payments and pass them through the account. It gives me a lot of mistrust. They have spoiled an app that was going great, clear and intuitive for this one that if it is not a scam, it seems it.;1;2021-06-04;15.21.0
5153;Lubiel;Very unintuitive. It gives errors when trying to cancel sanctions, in addition to taking you out of the app and taking you to a web page to do it. Above each time you have to choose a city and write the license plate. Of three sanctions that I have tried to cancel, I only get one confirmed (and we will see why they have not charged me at the moment I suppose they will notify me to make a payment with PayPal, which is my payment method), the other two are in limbo and You cannot even know if they have been canceled, since they do not appear as pending or paid. Before putting this app under my nose, I used ePark (which was super simple and effective) and gave it a thousand turns. I don't understand how they force you to change from a fantastic app to one that is nonsense. I'm Sorry, but it's like that.;1;2021-06-03;15.21.0
5154;Beachbomber85;They just gave me a parking ticket when I am 100% sure that I paid with the app. In the app section it only appears that I have extended the time but not the initial parking. Now who pays me this fine?;1;2021-05-28;15.21.0
5155;El mercader;Hi, this is my first time using EasyPark. The transition from E-Park has been very good.

If they can improve it, I'll pin more stars on them. Thanks.;3;2021-05-13;15.20.1

5160;luz_dia_noche;That is not business, it is usury. Every time you put in a ticket, you have to go to the cashier to pay the commission. If you want an invoice, you have to pay for that service.

5173;rodelius;It is very expensive to park with her. Charge a fixed commission every time you park.

5176;patricia garro;It is urgent that you enable the possibility that we can put tickets to several vehicles from the application (such as ePark) ... in a house where there are several vehicles should be able to put tickets in all at the same time ... and it is not necessary that the person who bring a car, you have to have this application (since not everyone knows how to use a mobile phone) ... I think it is something very necessary. And I do not know if you can see if you have a fine and pay it as you could from the other. I was not a fan of ePark, I think it worked fatal but of course the fines and being able to pay several vehicles now that is something you have to enable as soon as possible.;5;2021-05-11;15.20.1

5179;Manurocker95;I have been using ePark for a long time and was very happy with it. It was easy to use and intuitive. They have forced me to go to easy park and the change for the worse is brutal. To begin with, it is a lot less intuitive. As another user mentions, it makes no sense that for it to take you until 9:00 the next day, you have to keep hitting the wheel. In ePark, at 9 pm he was already jumping the next day. After that, he won't let you put on until 9:00 p.m. It must be at 8:59 p.m. If you get caught by one of traffic that minute you get a safe fine because that last minute is not covered. Afterwards, I don't know if they don't have designers or UX but the little wheel thing is much worse than what there was before (which was more like a half slider). I really don't understand this change for the worse.;1;2021-05-10;15.20.1
5180;xeny 🐛;It lets you extend the hours and you think the ticket is on and it isn't. The end parking button shouldn't be there.

5185;Tu p madre 95;They are very smart, they give you the time you want to be instead of the price you want to pay, let me explain. For instance, € 0.15 = 20 minutes, with this application you want to park for 15 minutes, because you pay € 0.15, do you want 17 minutes? You pay € 0.15 too. Do you want 20? Well, 15 cents.;1;2021-05-05;15.20.1

5190;Nacho Tejerina;Previously, I had the e-park application and it said that in a single click it would pass your data (car license plates, balance, etc.) to EASYPARK. Well, that is not true and due to a failure in the application, my data has not been passed correctly and I have been fined.  When complaining about this error in the application, the customer service was disregarded and their treatment has been regrettable, without offering any type of solution.  I will definitely not use this app again.;1;2021-05-01;15.20.1
5191;pepitoalambrito;I was using ePark which worked perfectly and one fine day it disappeared and transferred my balance to EasyPark. I have used it until it is exhausted, it is lousy !! Bad design, even because of the colors, not very intuitive, 0 clear, 0 comfortable, unreliable. The change has been much worse.;1;2021-04-30;15.20.1
5192;elBlizzer;But let's see what disaster is this app? Why does it force me to download this APP if I already had the previous one and it was going very well ??? Above here he does not let me extend the time, he tells me all the time "extend more time if you want to extend it" but I'm already doing it! And nothing!! Instead of at 10:23 I am setting at 11:00 with the wheel (which on top of it goes the other way around) "extend more time if you want to extend it" ???? Can someone explain something to me and why it gives so many problems .. what a horror of APP;1;2021-04-29;15.20.1
5193;Virquintan;They charge you a commission of € 1.50 for each transaction. I will not use it again !!;1;2021-04-28;15.20.1
5194;Julián T;It has a giant button in the center that induces you to make the slightest touch around it and charges you without a refund. If they know the regulations in Madrid, they should at least ask for confirmation. I was just checking how it worked and skipped the maximum charge. That was not the case with the previous one. I will look for another alternative.;1;2021-04-28;15.20.1

5197;Archa-on;I wanted to make a complaint because I was fined for the first time using the EasyPark app.  I had been using the E-Park app for a while without any problems. I received several notices when my parking time was about to end so that I could renew it if necessary. When I changed the application, I was not notified and they have given me a fine that also cannot be canceled ...  For my part, I do not think I will use it again and what is more, I spoke with the person who gave me the fine because I looked for it to ask for information and he has told me to use another application ...  If even the operators say to use another better, then we will have to pay attention to them.;1;2021-04-27;15.20.1
5198;22/04/2021;Every time one expands the parking lot they charge you 0.18. There are better applications.  I use other applications in other places and they do not charge. I understand that you have to pay for the service but each extension? It is expensive.;1;2021-04-24;15.20.0
5199;diegogonzalez;Very nice but thanks to the application the info does not reach the controller and it has cost me € 90 for 5 minutes, a shame;1;2021-04-23;15.20.0

5201;Jfhmerida;I used the application in its oldest version and more or less it fulfilled its functions well. Now when renewing the application, you mention some improvements that cannot be met in my area. You can stop at the parking lot if you go before, not in my area. They charge you the schedule you have set. You can expand the parking lot, not in my area. You have to pay the minimum if you want to extend the parking lot. This is curious because the previous application did let you do it and did not announce it as a novelty. In short, it makes it easier for you not to look for the finish to pay and to be able to renew the parking without going to the car. But in my area, these novelties of paying the exact amount or prolonging the parking lot are not fulfilled.;3;2021-04-19;15.19.0
5202;lamamalola;It turns out that they make me change from epark to this one, which according to them would be the same. Well, in this app they do not charge a commission for making the payment with it, which was never the case in the other. Now I can't find any app to pay the parking meter that doesn't charge me commission and if I download the epark app again, it will take me to this one again.;1;2021-04-23;15.20.0
5203;ahdkdndjdbdicncgcsksodnc;When making the change from epark, it has brought me by default one that was not mine, it does not identify the complaint number, there is no time limit but if you go past 9:00 p.m. it does not let you save, it does not save the payment method .

5204;MireiaAri;A lousy app !! Please return ePark to us !!!  This app requires you to be in front of the car to put it. You can't go out and activate it on the way. It is slow to detect where you are ... If time passes you have to go to the car again ... nothing functional !!! The grace of the app is not having to go to the car .... !! 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️ I end up putting physical ticket again ...... A hoax! Looking forward to another!;1;2021-04-22;15.20.0

5211;David muela;App more complicated than the previous one, everything more tangled and difficult to intuit compared to the previous one. I had to pay a fine for a malfunction of the same, when it came to extending the ticket it failed a lot and it took a long time to extend it. All the time it fails and it costs you to pay the fine which you cannot pay in the app and it sends you to another Internet page where it also fails and says “Wow, oops! It seems there was an error. Try again" And the fine instead of paying the € 4, they charge you the € 4.60 for the procedures / service plus VAT that you have done them yourself. Either you improve the app or leave the previous one that worked well.;1;2021-04-18;15.19.0

5213;perireview;Epark was infinitely better than this app. Intuitive zero and functional zero. It makes me angry to have to post comments like this, but that being charged directly to your account, without being able to recharge your to keep track of spending is the worst. Also comment that when you put a ticket and want to expand it, I don't know if the app is wrong or that I'm stupid, but it won't let you. Now I have a ticket in place, as soon as I finish I unsubscribe and go to the competition.  Note that neither the dates are correct in the application. Today is Saturday, and it says that the ticket was posted on Thursday, April 17. Oh my ...;1;2021-04-17;15.19.0

5217;leticiamarxo;on two occasions the start button was activated without me pressing, without even being able to change the license plate of the car and it is not possible to cancel it, so I have had to pay twice for the same parking. again I changed zone and he did not get the location, he put the map on me but he assigned me the previous zone. Much better the epark version that is new.;1;2021-04-16;15.19.0
5218;AinhoaTM;You have to go from epark to this one to pay commission for each parking ... it seems like a joke. Let's see if they take out an app from the city council that with the covid it is not normal not to be able to pay from the mobile and when doing so pay a 10% commission;1;2021-04-16;15.19.0
5219;Bev2105;It's a bit messy and they also charge commissions that they shouldn't.;2;2021-04-13;15.19.0
5220;VictorNV;I have been forced to switch from ePark to EasyPark. While with ePark I paid the normal rates, EasyPark charges you commissions for using its app. I refuse to pay for something that until two days ago was free to use;1;2021-04-15;15.19.0
5221;Saritasarasaris;I used it last Friday, having passed its due charge. What is my surprise when I check my bank App and I see that they have charged me again on Monday I do not know what without having used the App. Nefarious, I do not recommend it.;1;2021-04-15;15.19.0
5222;Deltorno;A disaster. It does not locate without gps, it does not take the ORA schedules and it lets you hire hours and hours, to see penalties it takes you to the web, ... everything was done by e-park before perfectly.;1;2021-04-15;15.19.0
5223;Fl1pa0;Well, that is a scam, they charge you an abusive commission to the point that you almost pay double for putting 30 cents. I will spend what is left of my balance and there these scammers stay. Back to scrap the car  Edited to respond to the developer: It's a scam to be charged more for the same as before was free on EPark, it's that easy. So to put coins in the car and get the ticket in the machine that little money will smell at least from me.;1;2021-04-15;15.19.0
5224;ajficiifoelgodowkqndoei;It is unfortunate that they make you necessarily change applications to charge you a fee for the service when with ePark this was not the case and in addition it was much simpler and more intuitive.

5227;Parnassos08;Switching from E-park to this app has certainly gotten worse. This is more expensive, intuitive zero and does not go with recharge but directly against the card. I have already changed the application and canceled this;1;2021-04-15;15.19.0
5228;easyparknotsoeasy;Hi, this afternoon I tried to use it and it didn't work. A window would come out with a message that there was no internet connection, when in fact there was.

5230;solDC-Madrid;I had almost € 10 of balance in ePark when I did the migration and according to reports the balance migrated together with the user but now the balance is neither in this app nor in the old one. Also, when I want to log into the web to contact someone (from the app they redirect you to the web) it does not recognize my ePark username. Disastrous. Not to mention that they do not inform before migrating that they will charge commissions every time they park.;1;2021-04-14;15.19.0

5234;pepe3129;A very difficult to use intuitive scratch app. And worst of all, before you paid the fine (€ 4) charged by the town hall and that's it. Now if you want to pay it, they charge you € 4.6, € 4 to the town hall and 60centimos commission, a 15% commission ... small interests you put champions! 👏🏽  At least if the application was milk ... it was a thousand times better ePark To scam your house!;1;2021-04-13;15.19.0

5237;Tanelorm;What a scam. They force you to go from EPark to EasyPark since they had to buy it, and if they did not charge a commission for tickets for parking in Madrid, they have started to charge you at least € 0.15 plus VAT (€ 0.18 in total). That is, you spend five minutes to drop the children off at school, which is € 0.05, and you end up paying € 0.23. A shame, a fucking shame. Logically, I am going to request a refund of the money that I had in EPark and that I have been forced to put in EasyPark and I am going to delete the APP.;1;2021-04-13;15.19.0
5238;pablovh12;It is a scam, you go from an intuitive and easy-to-use app to a CARA app that charges you a commission for parking !!! When it was free with el-park. A huge failure by e-Park, down by 3 ... 2 ... 1;1;2021-04-12;15.19.0
5239;Rexa90;They have forced me to go to this one, since before in my city we used the epark that was wonderful. This now you pay for each time a commission of 10% plus VAT ...

I've been in and out of the app 3 times and I don't get the option of the wheel to expand the ticket, which means that I have to create a new one, with the inconvenience and the extra expense that this entails. The time it sets is the activation time and not the time they begin to charge for parking, which is confusing.

When you are setting the time, as you neglect and touch the button, it is activated without asking you to confirm it. And the worst thing is that it does not let you extend the time, once activated. In the history, the trips he has made appear, but what each one has cost does not come. They are passing me charges by the bank that I do not recognize, and when I go to check them I cannot because in the history they do not appear.

5276;Davidelmandri;As expected, they have not transferred the balance that I had in e-park. Do not download this application, there are many that you can trust.;1;2021-03-23;15.18.1
5277;Jucava;The other version was excellent !!, when my wife had to pay for parking, it was super simple, she would put her license plate and go. Now it is very cumbersome and requires each one to have their app, I don't know if you are going to solve it ..., and as many say when you park you have to be moving the blue point until the parking place comes out, it is a bit confusing , the other was super intuitive. I imagine that you will fix it. Thanks;3;2021-03-22;15.18.1
5278;Rebecapchsama;Super dissatisfied with the app, it is not easy to use and above all more expensive than before, the payments pass days later, the developers have shown off with an application that worked perfectly, there is an app that is confusing and does not work well and a theft, and without prior notice, I hope they change it soon or I will stop using it I prefer to pay for a garage space than to be robbed every day;1;2021-03-21;15.18.1
5279;Marta Rgb;It is not intuitive at all, it does not work out how to recharge the balance or if you want to extend the time of a ticket, I have used ePark all my life but after this I delete this app;1;2021-03-20;15.17.1
5280;jgj46;It does not warn of the end of time, it does not locate well ... the ePark version much better. A shame;1;2021-03-19;15.17.1
5281;22esther22;It does not do the location well and they have given me a fine for not being in the right area ... I do not like anything;1;2021-03-18;15.17.1
5282;Wallander48;Today, March 15, impossible to connect, a notice of LACK OF COVERAGE appears ..... and I am where I always are ..... it is an indispensable app and so far super effective;5;2021-03-15;15.17.1
5283;Elians;Let's see, this morning I received a message saying that epark is now easypark, I am going to park in half an hour and it already forces me to change. Couldn't you give us advance notice ??? Leave a day for us to make the change ??? On the other hand, the map is terrible! In the Nueva España neighborhood in Madrid, the color is so dark that you can't see which street you have parked on !! In the Epark map there were references to shops, offices, hospitals that helped you to find yourself, obviously I don't know the streets where I park !! If I have an app, it is to avoid going to the parking meter to check what neighborhood I am in or to look at which street I have parked ... on the other hand, I YES I am in Madrid and the stop button is superfluous !!! It is easier for you to find a way to cancel the ticket in order to save, it will not take 3 seconds, but canceling it is too easy !! These criticisms and I just put it ... To those of Epark: thanks to the customers you have come this far, you could already worry about having notified before and that the app will reach the standards that you had ... to see if it improves and I can change the stars ...;2;2021-03-16;15.17.1
5284;CarmenC74;I was delighted with e-park that did not charge commission and with this app they have charged me almost 20 cents for an hour of parking in the blue zone. Where before I paid 50 cents now I pay 73 cents! What a robbery. In addition, the app is designed fatally and it is very easy to overpay and it is not clear if you can extend the ticket. As soon as my balance runs out, I'll move on to another.;1;2021-03-16;15.17.1
5285;Rita4050;It is neither easy nor intuitive. I have switched from ePark to EasyPark because I thought it was an improvement but quite the opposite. It does not offer the possibility of recharging a balance, as with ePark. Today I have used it for the first time and also for the last time. When parking, the app has taken my location by GPS and when I cannot find how to confirm this location, I have trusted. When I returned to the car I had a non-voidable fine because it has taken the location of another neighborhood ... a disaster !! Yes ... your explanation is that we must confirm the location .. of course! Balls out .. The application does not locate well and that is your responsibility, I see from the reviews that I am not the only one to whom it has happened .. With e-park I never had any problem of this type, What's more, when you were in an area with the possibility that the ticket belonged to one neighborhood or another depending on the street, the app warned you, in addition to locating perfectly. Who refunds me the amount of the fine for malfunctioning of the app ...? Now I want to delete my payment details and I can't find how to do it either. If you call your app “easy ... it should really be easy !!;1;2021-03-16;15.17.1
5286;l.c.681;much better the previous e-park, a shame;1;2021-03-15;15.17.1
5287;joncock;It charges commissions when the website of the town hall says no. Town hall fee 1.30 with application kk fees € 1.48 !!!! Someone explain it to me please.;1;2021-03-15;15.17.1
5288;Reseapp;The way to indicate the duration of parking, without a confirmation step has all the earmarks of designed to steal, they have stolen € 8 from me when I only needed € 0.50. Do not let cancel.;1;2021-03-13;15.17.1
5289;fjhorrillo;It leaves much to be desired compared to any other app of the style, it charges you without confirmation, when you set the time you do not know how much you are putting in and it is more than likely that when you turn the roulette you will hit it in the center and hire the ticket 
3-12-2021: Thank you for answering, but the first thing I did was call the telephone number that you indicate where, yes, they very kindly told me that they would not refund my money because the error was mine.  He reiterated the application is terrible, it has many usability problems, it lacks functionalities that e-park had, such as that you select the area by gps and thus avoid choosing the one that is not, because who knows the numbers? If I have to go to the parking meter to see the number I already pay at the ... As for there are users who do not want the confirmation screen, it is very simple, just as to charge an SMS you put a configuration option, because you put another for people who prefer not to steal them because the application does not work as it should;1;2021-03-12;15.17.1
5290;Frasc0;Very poorly designed, the roulette system for time is very imprecise and as soon as you are careless it begins to count the time and when you stop it it is impossible to set time again. You do not see the balance being transferred again or the amount loaded easily.;1;2021-03-12;15.17.1
5291;Kesesale;E-park might even be a bit 'seedy', so to speak, but it worked very well. It did its job perfectly. This app ... Well, it seems that instead of moving forward it goes backwards. Operation is complicated, sometimes it tries to charge the card without consulting ... Bad, very bad.;1;2021-03-12;15.17.1
5292;Catikic;The only parking meter app that you pay SERVICE COST ... over 10% !? Don't count on me.;1;2021-03-12;15.17.1
5293;Mañasaña1;It seems to me an abuse that they force you to eliminate the previous version called Epark, now 7 minutes of parking in a green zone goes from 10 cts to 28. Isn't that an abuse?;1;2021-03-12;15.17.1
5294;usuario retiro;This is not working for me. I can't even get in. How can I continue to use e-Park? I was happy and they have screwed me. I shouldn't have accepted the change. Now I can't get the old option back. I closed both and opened again but I can't. Easy Park always appears to me. A roll. Today I had to pay with coins, thank goodness I was carrying loose money.;1;2021-03-11;15.17.1
5295;E. killers;It has quite a few flaws;3;2021-03-08;15.17.1
5296;Don2din;I was using e-Park, and the app itself asked me to switch to easypark. I accepted, and he migrated the data and money. The first time I used it, it turns out that it kept the last parking area that I had used in e-Park, or where I had installed it. The truth is that I do not check the GPS, and I put the ticket in the area that I mentioned instead of where it was physically. The ticket was passed to me and I made 2 more parking spaces in the same place, and only in the last one did he realize it and did it in the correct area. I have complained to easypark and their only possibilities are either that I have done something wrong or that the GPS of my phone, an iPhone, does not work well. So I pay the fine, but yes, the app delete it.;1;2021-03-11;15.17.1
5297;Persebeiro77;The e-park had no problem, however the first time I use this app I pay two tickets for the same parking almost without realizing it ... Very poorly executed. Very good to make a mistake and have your credit "stolen" without even using it. Why allow a 1 min timer if the minimum is 30 ctms for 30 minutes? How can there not be a payment confirmation? I will stop using it;1;2021-03-11;15.17.1
5298;Timo-flex;If you agree to migrate the account, they keep the money and you will not see it again. There is no way to get it back  You are warned;1;2021-03-10;15.17.1
5299;1Mar-D;Like so many others, if I know, I endure epark until the end. Not only do they charge you for the service, but also the interface is unnecessarily complicated. For example, to check if I have a complaint in the vehicle I have to enter the EasyPark website, I cannot do it through the application itself, which seems to me an unnecessary complication since it makes me enter the data of the vehicle.;1;2021-03-10;15.17.1
5300;Ainander;Before I used ePark and they forced me to change and now they charge me for using the app;1;2021-03-09;15.17.1
5301;Fermartinezluna;It took me 30 minutes to try to pay, not only is it NOT intuitive but it was impossible to pay after having completed all the steps. Even worse since they forced me to change! I don't think they will last long if they don't change! Luck!;1;2021-03-09;15.17.1
5302;Payboy69;It turns out that I used epark and now you have to use this app that is more complicated and on top of that they charge you a fee every time you use it. Before for 30 minutes parked you pay 30 cents, now for the same time it is 48 cents. It will seem silly but if you use it often in the day it is not profitable.;1;2021-03-09;15.17.1
5303;michelon14_88;I liked the old app better. The parking starts at 9 am but if you arrive at 8:50 it starts charging you from then on.;1;2021-03-09;15.17.1

5317;David Mart 1985;In A Coruña, with the original e-park application, I paid € 1.30 to park for 2 hours, 15% less than with this app (€ 1.48). Geolocation is a nuisance, it consumes a lot of battery and if you don't want to activate it, it makes you waste time locating your car on the map and you risk being fined if you don't define it correctly. To top it off, there is no confirm parking button, so if you get lost, you can pay for parking involuntarily as it happened to me. In short, I can't think of any reason to keep using it. I have returned to the previous app. The money that is left to buy bots with fake reviews in the store could well be used to offer a competitive rate.;1;2021-01-20;15.15.0

If you claim it and show that you were on the correct street but the application picks up a different one, its answer is that it is your responsibility and be attentive.

5369;balalí;I have used EasyPark this weekend and due to its malfunction, the time that I marked in the App (Saturday 2:03 pm) was not set and it changed to 11am, no notification was sent and on Sunday when I got the car I had a fine for having passed the hour. I called today and they are not responsible for ANYTHING. Shame of service and app. DO NOT TRUST EASYPark !! Or you will almost certainly have to pay a fine !!!;1;2018-07-02;10.9

5373;Doctor_Morbius;Nov-2017 Confirmed: CANNOT pay in my city and the application supports payment !!!  Sep-2017 In my city it seems that it can no longer be used, but the application still supports payment. It recognizes my location as a valid area to pay with this App so I thought that both could be used. ERROR !!!;1;2017-11-29;10.0.3
5374;Mario Miranda;The application is very comfortable, since it allows you to have control over the renovation of the parking lot in the blue zone, but I have already been fined twice having it activated and I have had to waste time in going to the city hall of my city to complain and present proof that at the time of the sanction, I had my ticket paid.  Thanks.;1;2017-10-26;10.0
5375;CarmenMM;I have been using it for more than a year and not a single fault. They annoy the 19 cents per operation but it is compensated by putting the maximum time and then stopping it when you leave, so they only charge you for the time you are there. It is a convenience not to have to be with the tickets. The only negative is not having the option to expand before your time is up.;4;2016-01-05;5.2
5376;Madmulder;This app charges you a commission for using it, and also in short stays the cost shoots up. In my city there is another one that serves the same purpose without any type of surcharge. I don't understand why the user should pay more to use an app from a municipal concession. Sorry, but I'll stick with Telpark. It costs the same as paying at the machines and offers the same functionalities without surcharges.;1;2017-09-29;5.9.1
5377;Ctujvfryn;It has not worked for a year in Sant Joan Despi, after paying correctly with EasyPark, I found the complaint. Now I have a nice proof of payment from EasyPark and a complaint of € 24.04 from sant joan despi for not paying the blue zone.

5378;Tarque79;How can it be that you give service in Sant Joan Despí and charge it, if from SABA they say that the app no ​​longer works in the municipality? They have not reported me because I have found the guard in the area. What solution do you give?;1;2017-03-07;5.8.4
5379;Pablomar81;It is very well thought out, even if it has a small commission. I give it 2 stars because if I give it 30 minutes and in 5 I finish it always keeps thinking and never lets me STOP IT, it stops when it reaches 30 min.
