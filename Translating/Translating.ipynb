      "179 I have been pleased with the EasyPark parking app. For example, when I go to the reception in Jorvi, I don't know how long it will take and then I'll put at least 4 hours. Usually I survive an hour and the app charges just the amount of time as long as you remember to stop it when you get in the car. There has also been a situation before the corona in the parking lot next to the Opera, where in the rain I have charged the parking time in peace in the car when there is a long queue in the rain in front of the field parking meter. Sometimes there is a bit of searching for the area number and it has to check the area parking meter sticker.\n",

The only thing that is bad is not always giving the correct area number if there are two areas next to each other, then you need to check that you have registered yourself in the right area. Once I experienced a situation where the parking attendant already wrote a fine even though an easy parking fee was installed and when I submitted the matter then the supervisor said I was in the right area but eadypark had registered parking in the adjacent area where my car was at the border.\n",

Now it turns out that someone who borrowed the car a few months ago naturally put it in the app to pay for parking, and that is the reason why we are not allowed to use the app. Suggestions for developers: Write more informative error messages than type \"Error.Message.11341\". A message like \"2 other people have added this car to their app. It can be in an app at most\" would have been very helpful. If possible, allow several people to enter the same car, with camera parking activated. If that's not possible, let me see which other users have put the same car in the app, with phone number.

      "271 Hi! The app is very handsome and light-hearted, really useful for a busy everyday life! One thing I think could have been an improvement is this with the choice of car and registration number. Here it is very easy to make mistakes as a user, which for me and many others has resulted in a fine - despite the fact that you have actually paid, but for a registration number that does not exist or a car that was obviously not in the parking lot. One idea could be to have a two-step registration of car numbers, so that it is easier to detect errors in registration if these two do not match. Or possibly a check against a register, which means that the registration number that does not exist is not approved by the app, and checks if the first two letters are in the registration number at all. Personally, I missed \"f\" and pressed \"r\" in a hurry - and \"NR\" does not exist. But the cure was there, because this was my fault, which I agree with! (Despite the fact that I think the parking attendant should have looked for the car he had paid for, and not found this, and then looked between his fingers and thought \"here is someone who has been human to misprint in the app\".) By improving it I have mentioned above, I think the app would be more \"foolproof\" and even more would have enjoyed and trusted the app, and that parking attendants do not have to take the brunt of the user's mistakes - which is often awkward to admit as a user :)\n",

The parking code of 3 or four digits are prone to mistakes in typing and complaining to easypark does not help as they are not the one renting out the parking lot. Easypark is not interested to improve the app as Europark makes more money with errors of the user. Strongly recommend to write these complaints so that the app gets improved. Parking lot codes should not be very similar. I had to type 9445 (Sandnes) but easypark app registered 944, which was a parking lot in Oslo.  Called immediately when I saw the fine in the window of my car. Everybody makes typing errors on the mobilphone. The software should be better and only a numeric keyboard should be given (similar when I use the Bank ID on my phone) to reduce the change on typing errors.  Finally do not use this app. Please boycot it until improved.\n",

      "651 I downloaded and used the parking app Easy Park. As it appears from the app, I left a note visible with \"Easy park\" written in the car until the wafer arrived by post. I used the app's location service to find the tariff group. I do not know the exact address where I parked and chose the rate group that resembled the parking lot. All offered tariff groups gathered different types of parking, of which 2 out of three were entitled \"Garage\" and I consequently chose \"Street parking\" instead since I was parked outdoors. As it appears from my history, I have paid for hours and expensively for the place, but by using the place service I have chosen the wrong rate group. The guard who imposed the fine on me did not know about \"Easy park\", despite the fact that he imposed fines on the area, nor did he take the time to check surrounding tariff groups if this car had paid. To closely analyze offered tariff group titles or memorize a multi-digit tariff group digit readable but undercommunicated a good distance away at the vending machine, when a location service on a mobile (!) App is offered, is not ok. When complaining, Easy Park points out that one should read the terms of the app closely, and they do not go back on the fine even though they can see that I have paid. This is an app with helpless appraisal categories that make you dependent on precise address knowledge and that you go to the machine to double check. On top of this, the company has lousy customer service, and a poorly managed collaboration with EuroPark which imposes the fines.\n",

Have never got the correct zone number by pressing the \"nearby\" button, possibly I have only had bad luck with the places I parked, but it does not work the first five times the threshold is a bit high to give it more chances.

      "I use EasyPark diligently and have saved large amounts on parking. Arguments that it costs a lot to use EasyPark do not hold if you park a lot and for example are a lot in meetings with a somewhat uncertain end time. EasyPark is an ingenious solution and the app worked well to begin with, but for far (!) Long now it has not worked properly. I wrote an email to EasyPark about this several months ago where they replied that they are working hard to fix this. It turns out (obviously) that is not true. The concept is ingenious. Had the app worked, it would also have been ingenious, but now I only use the ring solution until further notice. When the app is updated and the receipt + GPS function is also included, the app gets top marks from me, but when will the app be usable again ..?\n",

On the other hand, when you choose the time that you are going to be parked, in the previous one it would automatically pass you to the next fraction of payment.

It is not intuitive. It does not report on the new conditions, or it does so in a cryptic way. It does not allow confirmation of parking, so if a mistake is made, either by the user or by the application, there is no going back. Yesterday I was testing the application from my home, since I had to go to Madrid an hour and a half later. He tells me at 5:50 p.m. that I am parked, and that it ended at 7:19 p.m. without giving the option to confirm, I called by phone and there was no way to go back. They blamed the City Council. And to me the anger for not reading the conditions I have entered the application several times and there is no way. It is possible that I am stupid, as they came to suggest, but as I see from the opinions, there are many of us. It is possible that the application is only for gifted people, so I will unsubscribe as soon as the claim that I have filed with the City Council is resolved. In the end I parked at twenty past six with the uncertainty of the possibility that four hours would pass and end up sanctioned. Fortunately, it was not. In short, a disaster.

By accepting the application change, which they impose on you, they charge you even if you park outside of the collection hours, nobody explains it to you if you don't call, but they have already stolen money from you. Some thieves! City Hall and Easy park wash their hands too. I put the ticket before 4 o'clock and if you want to pay until 6 o'clock, they charge you more than 1.30, and when they explain what to do and you do it, then they do not let you access the normal conditions such as for example. ticket extension as before.\n",

It costs the one that now has to pay a commission, and also high, because in short installments, for example 0.15 cts. you pay more in commission than in the cost of the parking itself.

And if you have fallen short, great, but if you spend time, because you were still adjusting it, too bad. To overpay. Furthermore, in Madrid you cannot stop parking.
