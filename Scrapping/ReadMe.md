<h3> Running </h3>
<h4> For Parkman: 
-Just run normally, the code will scrap reviews from finland and denmark, in english, Finnish, and danish
-Just make sure there is an csv file in the same directory named parkman.csv with the correct header

<h4>For EasyPark: <h4>
-Because we scrapped from all over europe and we did not want to write long useless repetettive code, we kept changing in the parameters the
countries and the languages
-so for android part change the language from  en,fi,fr,es,no depending on the country but use english one time to not duplicate the data, and change the countries from fi,fr,es,no
-and for ios part change the country from fi,no,dk,se,fr,es,de
-Keep running again and again until getting the desired amount of data
