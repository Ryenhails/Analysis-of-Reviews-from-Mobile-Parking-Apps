3386,VWMP,it is still not possible to remove a debit card thus it does not seem possible to activate the apple pay mode which did not work before so i added the card but now there is at least one button called labeladdpaymentbusinessaccount incidentally the app ends up in a somewhat locked position if the parking time expires at the same time as you try to spin until a new end time actually applied to the previous version but i suspect it is still so you wonder if anyone has even tried to use the app before it is uploaded why should everyone who reviews contact support these are such fundamental things that should be able to be taken care of from the app the fact that you cannot delete the card information should in principle be illegal may well lower the grade further,1,2018-02-07,10.3,-0.0516,,3386.0,neutral

3403,iYlva,i stand in the same entrance parking the times i park with the easypark app many new updates have made it better a big disadvantage is that after you have started your parking it is at least as easy to accidentally end it i did it cost me sek 750 i am moody in the app you end the parking at the exact same place where you start it you do not need to confirm that you want to end the parking elsewhere on the screen the app may be nicer in that way but for me it meant that after i had started the parking i ran towards the train threw the phone in my pocket there in my pocket i happened to finish my parking unintentionally now the next time i parked i checked lots of times that the parking is running an alternative to avoid these mistakes is to close the app but the backbone feeling says no what happens when you shut down netflix or spotify  well the movie or music ends its a bit the same feeling to shut down the app what makes me feel safe with my parking not closing there are things to improve here to avoid these mistakes im not impressed because a sek 20 parking lot cost me a fine of sek 750 when all i wanted was to do the right thing for me improve the app so that you do not accidentally interrupt your parking,1,2017-12-20,10.2,0.8492,,3403.0,positive

4157,Btotheone,i have had a very unfortunate experience with the apps registration of the location which resulted in my parking time starting in the wrong zone and thus a parking ticket the speed of the registration of which zone you are in and the ease of use in that you become aware of a possible incorrect registration while you are on the go i consider to be extremely poor compared to other parking apps in that case there was no question that i had left the car or that i had otherwise made a remote registration it was just that the app had not managed to register my location correctly despite the fact that i always give it some time when i open the app and that i was not aware that it had not registered it correctly the parking ticket was my mistake and therefore i paid for it but i definitely think that the app can handle a software update that makes it faster to register the location as it takes a long time again this is alone compared to other parking appsin addition one could consider whether the usability of the app should be updated so that the user can not avoid seeing or getting checked that it is in the wrong zone that is registered,1,2018-10-24,11.5,-0.7725,,4157.0,negative

4619,Mr. Friis,it is something  when there is an update which has some of the function that is in demand but that they then have a little difficulty getting them implemented in the right wayone is that im not particularly fond of the fave choice i would be able to look beyond that if it were not for the fact that the wheel does not add anyone worthy to the appi think that functions around gps and note for receipt are fine but when i every time i open the app have to say yes to some strange number like to use my position i get so upseti do not know if its html5 or one of the other tools but it stinks i wish i could use another tool mostly i use sms because i hate that appas jobs would have said i hate it,1,2013-01-20,3.0,-0.8128,,4619.0,negative

4696,Egooktamuck,the app is a success user interface and operation liked the additional costs that arise as a percentage of the actual parking fee are however too high at 15 it is even less favorable with shortterm parking because a minimum of  049 is mandatory for each parking process the optional  015 for an sms reminder to indicate the imminent end of parking time are completely inadequate its just plain antiquated and outrageous although i am not a fan of annoying advertising in apps it might be an option here to minimize the costs for the user,4,2018-06-19,10.8,-0.0124,,4696.0,neutral
4697,qudsgn,ive found the app very useful for years the ui was successful it already worked great on my 5s and that is also the case with the 8 the learning curve is extremely fast thanks for your coloring i hate blue apps germans are afraid of color you are a great exception but seriously changing the phone number is impossible this does not have to be solved in the app but i should be able to edit my account on the website i cant make the entrepreneur app appealing to my boss the payment methods are not sufficiently explained for my boss he has no desire to read a body of text id rather submit the parking garage receipt a table helps in my opinion your marketing has some catching up to do,5,2018-02-17,10.3.1,0.872,,4697.0,positive
4698,M Kaffee,i use easypark regularly and see this app as a great asset i finally dont have to search forever for parking machines and change it is particularly good that i can stop the parking process when i leave this uptotheminute billing saves me a lot of money because in the past i always put too much in the parking meter compared to the numbers today so that it just wouldnt expire i wouldnt have thought but it pays off well despite the commission due to easy park per process its great that it can now also be operated using an apple watch,5,2018-04-09,10.5,0.9505,,4698.0,positive
4699,ankn99,i have now been a very longtime user of easypark what i found good with the old app and sorely missed in the new one nowhere can i see when i have logged init would be extremely useful to see when you have logged in under the active parking processes submenualso on the main screen because the down counting counter plus the end time is mocked twice otherwise the app is easy to use,5,2018-01-11,10.2,0.8016,,4699.0,positive
4701,stefsen,ive been using the app for a long time even if i live in an area where there is little parking management that is supported of course this makes parking a little more expensive but the simple cashless operation makes up for ittoday i used the carplay version for the first time well done other providers of apps that can be used in the car can learn a bit from thiskeep it up,5,2021-03-18,15.17.1,0.5562,,4701.0,positive

4704,Grindergrinder,great thing very practical and easy its great that it supports carplay if it were a little cheaper and you didnt have to tell the parking time in advance i wouldnt use anything else  only one problem when i try to activate camera parking select the payment method and then click on the vehicle settings the next time the function is deactivated the box not selected there is also no confirmation or anything like that when i select it very funny now i dont know if it works or not ,5,2021-04-28,15.20.1,0.9521,,4704.0,positive
4707,Marretheka,the app is very well done i think the function which is currently only available in a few large cities is the active parking space availabilitywhat none of the parking apps can do however is the combination of navigation parking displaywhen im in a strange city and want to go to a certain address i have to concentrate on driving and navigating i cant open the parking app while driving to see where there are parking spaces especially since i dont yet know which municipality uses which provider there are now several cashless payment app providers which makes things even more difficult the whole thing is still expandablesince i travel a lot for work i now have 6 different apps which is annoying,3,2020-02-01,14.8,0.126,,4707.0,neutral

4710,Beatziehungsweise,it helps me a lot because im out in the field and can save myself the change i also think its good that only the actual time is billed but for shortterm parking a flat rate is charged that could be optimizedthe availability could also be optimized because unfortunately i cannot use the app in some areas although in the same city only in different places ,4,2021-09-14,15.26.0,0.5499,,4710.0,positive
4717,Matth'W,due to the lack of cash in coins i installed the app the first parking process was successful something went wrong on the second attempt on usedom the parking process has started properly then my return was delayed and i wanted to redeem it online one of the advertised features in the meantime my phone had logged into the win roaming network not only was the assignment to my vehicle lost worse it was not possible to create the vehicle again without further ado the app persistently refused because the format of the license plate did not match the typical country codeconclusion not to be used in border regions and abroad abroad anyway preferably not because in case of doubt the burden of proof that the fee has been paid must be in the national language in addition i am bothered by the arbitrary fees which vary from municipality to municipality and are sometimes charged with outrageous basic fees,2,2021-08-23,15.25.0,-0.9486,,4717.0,negative

4719,Insideyourdreams,actually im a big fan of the app and the convenience made me ignore the additional costs to the parking fees  but if as with the last updates i always have to enter my data update it or something else   then i can walk to the parking meter again the time saved is completely gone at the moment it would certainly be different if i used it every day  but it felt a lot better,3,2018-10-04,11.4,0.8898,,4719.0,positive
4722,OlivChr,the app is ingenious instead of looking for the parking meter first then hoping that you have the right change with you and that you estimate the parking time correctly you can now conveniently set the time in the car and simply adjust it on your smartphone if necessary we even used the app on holiday in italy on elba please try to convince the city of stuttgart of your advantages,5,2019-02-27,12.5,0.8908,,4722.0,positive
4724,MS.63,this app solves the annoying problem of having to commit to a parking time at the beginning of parking now you can simply book generously and cancel the parking process at the end result you only pay for the time actually used the extra fee per parking process is completely reasonable very good,5,2020-10-30,15.12.1,0.5622,,4724.0,positive

4763,Rene.K,at the beginning i was quite skeptical whether this would work well in the implementation reality and whether i would not get a ticket after all the surface of the app is well and neatly structured the parking zone code has always been correctly recognized automatically and operation is intuitive so far everything works perfectly the recommendation of the possible parking space finding fits as far as possible the easypark stickers for the windshield for 2 cars arrived promptly and are free of charge points are deducted due to the poor pricing either you take the overpriced subscription or pay a 15 surcharge on the parking price for occasional use i paid  397 in addition to the parking price of  404  801 total for a parking time of 15 hours thats not exactly a snap the next time ill put some cash in my pocket beforehand i wont use the app in the future unless a decent solution can be found for customers and providers,3,2019-08-15,13.8,0.8522,,4763.0,positive

4990,harre63,i installed the app with great pleasure and am a committed user alone the crooked amounts 89 cents 151   surprised me a bit  on the other hand is a minutebyminute billing  the push notification then only says total costs  089 it was completely clear to me these are the pure parking fees so far so good until i asked for an invoice and lo and behold in addition to the parking fee i am charged 12 cents in transaction costs for each transaction this is not shown or displayed anywhere neither in the app store on the website nor anywhere else if it is somewhere and i havent found it i beg your forbearance at least i havent found anything despite an intensive search it is also interesting when you request the invoice for a transaction then you get the message that the invoice will be sent automatically on the day of the debit of course i checked that and as expected an invoice never came on the day of the debit  only now at the moment when i requested the invoice it came to my email account by return post conclusion i have nothing against service fees because what costs nothing is not worth or collects data but to raise fees and not to present them transparently or to mark them in any other way is not possible for me and therefore in my opinion this is just modern highway robbery,1,2020-02-02,14.8,0.8928,,4990.0,positive
4993,karl-georg,ive been using easypark since june after the installation everything was fine no problem the possibility of saving the parking zone code and selecting it later from a list was particularly helpful in berlin there are areas where you park your car and look for the machine with a taxi the parking zone memory was simply great but then there was an update everything should get better instead of the last parking zone you now read a sequence of digits that of course has nothing to do with the correct codewell i reported it to easypark a total of three times they promised a correction soon but nobody said when it would be soon,4,2012-07-25,2.0,0.9233,,4993.0,positive

5018,rkr 1959,i have been using easypark for years including its predecessor and i am absolutely satisfied  both with the service itself as well as with the app and the further development in use  the spatial independence from the vehicle is particularly good i can control the parking process from any location that has access to mobile communications or the internet  i dont have to be at the vehicle the free phone number is also very good if the parking process is to be processed over the phone the ease of use both with the phone and the app is also good  if you have got used to a few specific terms eg complete the parking process means that the parking is ended  more clearly would be end the parking process is only a small example and does not limit the absolutely positive evaluation over the years initially as one of the first users for berlin i had contact with the support several times for various reasons and was regularly served in a friendly fast and targetoriented manner also here 5 stars conclusion highly recommended  greetings rkr,5,2013-01-10,3.0,0.9887,,5018.0,positive

5059,KMBmike,the app works perfectly so far but i installed it to save costs on shortterm parking but it doesnt work at allhere with us for example half an hour of parking costs 90 cents if you insert a coin this is also the minimum amount at the parking metersif i enter this parking time into the app ie 30 minutes or less eg 10 minutes easypark charges  136 extending the parking time to the minute only works to a limited extent so in the app yes but there are big leaps in terms of costs which are always more expensive than inserting coins despite the inside window sticker and paid parking time a parking attendant also wanted to issue a parking ticket which i saw in time when i referred to the sticker he just shrugged my shoulders  so when parking time is activated the app also says that you should put a note in the car  then what is the inside window sticker good forok if you dont have any change at hand then the app may make sense therefore 2 stars otherwise i recommend change firstly it is generally cheaper and secondly you avoid misunderstandings with the park attendantsthe app would be really useful among other things only if it would charge correspondingly little especially for shortterm parking of eg 10 minutes and not even charge more than you have to pay for half an hour by inserting a coin,2,2016-01-22,5.2,0.9676,,5059.0,positive

3207,ACU1975,simply completely miserable  twice now we have been fined because the app has1 entered stop mode2 it has changed parking space by itself i have also emailed to the company and received only a general answer that did not even address my issue for information we are both relatively technical so the technique of handling the app is basically no problem the problem is that the app lives its own life when in use honestly get the app in order the idea is good even though it is also reasonably provocative that you charge more for parking when you use the app instead of the parking machine  and sharpen customer service ,1,2019-03-16,12.6,-0.3406,,8604.0,neutral

3212,Vilde S. Jensen,hi the app is very handsome and lighthearted really useful for a busy everyday life one thing i think could have been an improvement is this with the choice of car and registration number here it is very easy to make mistakes as a user which for me and many others has resulted in a fine  despite the fact that you have actually paid but for a registration number that does not exist or a car that was obviously not in the parking lot one idea could be to have a twostep registration of car numbers so that it is easier to detect errors in registration if these two do not match or possibly a check against a register which means that the registration number that does not exist is not approved by the app and checks if the first two letters are in the registration number at all personally i missed f and pressed r in a hurry  and nr does not exist but the cure was there because this was my fault which i agree with despite the fact that i think the parking attendant should have looked for the car he had paid for and not found this and then looked between his fingers and thought here is someone who has been human to misprint in the app by improving it i have mentioned above i think the app would be more foolproof and even more would have enjoyed and trusted the app and that parking attendants do not have to take the brunt of the users mistakes  which is often awkward to admit as a user ,3,2019-03-03,12.6,0.9737,,8609.0,positive

3243,amcarmom,the app itself is very userfriendly what goes down horribly is that you can quickly get a parking ticket if you are not vigilant in other words do not use this app if you have a bad time are stressed or not when you park the car the app will find a parking machine for you and you will have an opportunity to pay there are several vending machines near each other and the app is just as happy to give you one that does not belong to the parking lot you are in once i was parked with several people i had paid correctly but three friends were fined for their cars next to mine because they had paid at the wrong vending machine i have now been fined myself because i have relied on the app in stress i have done everything right but have paid for an appliance that was a little further away and not for what belonged to my parking lot this was in the same parking lot and with a few meters in between so sum summarum the idea around the app usability etc is very good but it can quickly become expensive to use if you want to use this app you must each time go to the machine you find in the corresponding place you are in and then manually enter the machine id so it does not hold to see the machine over there a good  and necessary i mean  change on this app had to be that it on the map showed all the p machines around where you stood not just one,2,2018-12-12,11.7.1,0.589,,8640.0,positive

4136,Isaac Tejada,i correct my review excuse me the error comes that it does not automatically jump from the end time to the next start time it would be fine so as not to have to spend 12h turning the wheel it would also be good that once you have arrived at the payment limit example 170 it will not let you continue spending hours so as not to lead you to believe that you have more time again sorry for the previous comment,3,2021-05-03,15.20.0,0.1868,,9533.0,neutral
4137,lara veira,terrible do not trust if you look at the penalties because even if they tell you that there is no maybe yes and they advise you to go to the parking meter to check  for this it is better to remove the option from the app if it is of no use  even above they have a record that if you have looked at the sanctions and that you have a ticket prior to the expiration of the sanction but they are not responsible  of course the sanctioning company also washes its hands,1,2021-05-03,15.20.0,-0.8121,,9534.0,negative

5122,Lauritamarbella,it says that epark is now easy park but the reality is that with epark you paid the official rate and with easy park you get an additional surcharge to the rate you would pay at the ticket vending machine it is also not very transparent in this aspect and it does not warn you that you are paying the same for 15 minutes as for 30 minutes to allow you to mark the maximum time you have for what you pay of course they have eliminated the sharing of the ticket they are going to earn money not to facilitate the obligatory payment of parkimetro like the other apps the best is telpark,2,2021-06-19,15.22.0,0.9645,,10519.0,positive

5142,DanCasRom,the ux is a far cry from the previous epark app the click to action for the payment method is terrible instead of putting the time and payment selector apart they put both on a wheel and the one that your finger goes slightly they charge you without prior confirmation the time marked in that moment by the wheel so that you cannot verify if it is correct or not nor cancel the payment i feel cheated exactly that has happened to me not being able to cancel the parking made by mistake because there is no button for it i wrote an email to the customer service email telling them what happened and attaching data and a screenshot they have called me by phone which i appreciate and the answer is that in madrid they cannot cancel or cancel errors because the city council does not allow them that option i understand that the city council can set some rules but if so then easypark should change the current design of the payment mode at least in madrid put separate buttons for selecting time and payment so that it is not so easy to make the mistake to pay for a parking that you do not want to do or for the unwanted time otherwise it will seem that they want to take advantage of all those charges committed by mistake i will report both the app and the city council to the consumer office because i honestly think it is a real scam towards users and customers of course i do not recommend anyone to use this app at least as long as they do not change the payment method,1,2021-06-07,15.22.0,-0.9707,,10539.0,negative
