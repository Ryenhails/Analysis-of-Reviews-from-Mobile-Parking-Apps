3200,thadvnt79,used easyparks gps positioning to find the parking lot after the app identified exactly where i stood i started parking this resulted in a fine as easypark had marked the wrong tariff  code they take no responsibility at all for this im far from the only one who has been affected feel free to read other reviews and other users experience of easypark on eg trustpilot i see that i have received an answer from the app developer you should be extremely aware that the information presented in the app is not as simple as the app manufacturer wants it to appear also do not forget that easypark makes its money regardless of whether you as a user are fined or not but that says something about a parking company whose vision is to improve the urban experince instead of having the vision to help users easily park correctly and ensure that parking fines are avoided i want to claim that easyparks gps function helps to do the opposite and there are several reviews here from people who have experienced the same thing as me in addition the name of the app contributes to the problem as it is promised to be simple but in comparison with other services it is the direct opposite after further answers from where you claim that you want to try to help your customers as best as possible the statement remains that you fail with it quite often by the way still looking for the gallup survey that you refer to on your website regarding customer satisfaction and ang if i have been in contact with your customer service yes of course i have at first glance it looks like a professional answer but for anyone who has parked at some point and then been fined i dare say that your answer is perceived as extremely condescending for those of you who read this review really take a look at other peoples reviews also regarding easypark and its app and think about whether there might not be a better alternative when you park for example a company that also takes care of the fine and in this way actually has a much greater responsibility and thus better opportunities to really help parking customers than a company like easypark what if i had to pay the actual fee to easypark even though i was fined of course i got ,1,2020-06-12,15.8,0.9952,,3200.0,positive

4157,Btotheone,i have had a very unfortunate experience with the apps registration of the location which resulted in my parking time starting in the wrong zone and thus a parking ticket the speed of the registration of which zone you are in and the ease of use in that you become aware of a possible incorrect registration while you are on the go i consider to be extremely poor compared to other parking apps in that case there was no question that i had left the car or that i had otherwise made a remote registration it was just that the app had not managed to register my location correctly despite the fact that i always give it some time when i open the app and that i was not aware that it had not registered it correctly the parking ticket was my mistake and therefore i paid for it but i definitely think that the app can handle a software update that makes it faster to register the location as it takes a long time again this is alone compared to other parking appsin addition one could consider whether the usability of the app should be updated so that the user can not avoid seeing or getting checked that it is in the wrong zone that is registered,1,2018-10-24,11.5,-0.7725,,4157.0,negative

4985,Barandur,the transaction fees are very often extremely high in relation to the parking fee actually usury alternatively take a look at the provider parknow there are fees with every transaction that in itself is completely understandable the provider has to finance itself somehow since the actual parking fee has to be paid back to the city at easypark these transaction fees can either be fixed and independent of the parking fees or they depend on the parking fee which is the case in most of the parking zones at easypark in the latter variant the transaction fee can be very very expensivein berlin for example it is 15 of the parking fee but at least  049 49 cents is only 15 from a parking fee of around  327in berlin one hour usually costs  1so i would have to park for almost 35 hours so that i really only pay 15 of the parking fee as a transaction fee from then on it becomes more and more expensive with the transaction feethere are also parking zones in berlin where you pay  2 per hour from 6pm to midnight the 15 transaction fee for easypark is worthwhile from 145 am parking time because from then on the transaction fee rises continuously if i also consider that i often only park somewhere for half an hour for 50 cents then the transaction fee is almost 100 of the parking fee and thats really bold what actually happens if i want to extend the parking time do i then pay at least 49 cents again there is another wayat parknow you only pay 25 cents per bookingor alternatively  299  month without charge per booking167 that is why easypark only gets 1 star,1,2019-02-23,12.5,0.7992,,4985.0,positive
4988,geplagter Handyparkkunde,somebody was probably not paying attention and implemented the design draft of a nineyearold girl without thinking too much even minor updates keep changing the ui with a clear tendency confusing and even more pink obvious activities such as setting the parking time etc are hidden behind overloaded pink rotary controls which when cranking also like to trigger a paid parking process at the same time it has to look for easter eggs first yes where could it be this time and then a gambling component great therefore in case the gentlemen should have forgotten the minimal task was a digital parking ticket but they preferred to build an annoying app that repeatedly forces unexpected user interaction _everything_ shines really well with a lot of blingbling  just howling when you look at the average parking meter as an alternative it seems to be particularly important to the current crew to display unexpected and pointless comments between the customers and the start of the parking process yesterday i had to talk to the policewoman for a long time because a parking process was ultimately not started the app really wanted to tell me modally that i needed such a sticker in the car oh no great thanks ive been a mobile phone parking customer for 10 years and thus probably have a much longer business relationship with the company than most of my developers there but i didnt know that i needed a sticker as a reference for the zettelhex  im curious when i will be told that cats cannot be dried in the microwave honestly hopefully it will be something else otherwise ill switch back to change and parking machines it doesnt sting so much in the eyes and it hurts a lot less behind the forehead,1,2017-12-15,10.2,0.9731,,4988.0,positive

3212,Vilde S. Jensen,hi the app is very handsome and lighthearted really useful for a busy everyday life one thing i think could have been an improvement is this with the choice of car and registration number here it is very easy to make mistakes as a user which for me and many others has resulted in a fine  despite the fact that you have actually paid but for a registration number that does not exist or a car that was obviously not in the parking lot one idea could be to have a twostep registration of car numbers so that it is easier to detect errors in registration if these two do not match or possibly a check against a register which means that the registration number that does not exist is not approved by the app and checks if the first two letters are in the registration number at all personally i missed f and pressed r in a hurry  and nr does not exist but the cure was there because this was my fault which i agree with despite the fact that i think the parking attendant should have looked for the car he had paid for and not found this and then looked between his fingers and thought here is someone who has been human to misprint in the app by improving it i have mentioned above i think the app would be more foolproof and even more would have enjoyed and trusted the app and that parking attendants do not have to take the brunt of the users mistakes  which is often awkward to admit as a user ,3,2019-03-03,12.6,0.9737,,8609.0,positive
3218,Miarala,the app easily jumps from zone to zone when i leave the car park at the same time as i am registering parking in the app it has jumped to the neighboring car park which is a maximum of 30 meters away when you are not known it is not easy to know if you are choosing the right zone and ergo you get a parking ticket because you have entered the wrong zone which may be as little as 1020 meters away from the one you have parked on,1,2019-02-13,12.5,-0.5116,,8615.0,negative

3243,amcarmom,the app itself is very userfriendly what goes down horribly is that you can quickly get a parking ticket if you are not vigilant in other words do not use this app if you have a bad time are stressed or not when you park the car the app will find a parking machine for you and you will have an opportunity to pay there are several vending machines near each other and the app is just as happy to give you one that does not belong to the parking lot you are in once i was parked with several people i had paid correctly but three friends were fined for their cars next to mine because they had paid at the wrong vending machine i have now been fined myself because i have relied on the app in stress i have done everything right but have paid for an appliance that was a little further away and not for what belonged to my parking lot this was in the same parking lot and with a few meters in between so sum summarum the idea around the app usability etc is very good but it can quickly become expensive to use if you want to use this app you must each time go to the machine you find in the corresponding place you are in and then manually enter the machine id so it does not hold to see the machine over there a good  and necessary i mean  change on this app had to be that it on the map showed all the p machines around where you stood not just one,2,2018-12-12,11.7.1,0.589,,8640.0,positive

4556,Maria Garcia,after critical and even negative reviews and being able to communicate by phone with them i have to say that in my case the problem lies in a technical problem of information that the application gives the user which leads to confusion about the use and cost of the application app once explained by tony everything has been clarified and i have been able to confirm with my invoices that there is indeed no extra charge for the service i do not give 5  for this reason and i give it 4  for good customer service,4,2020-12-17,15.14.1,-0.9287,,9953.0,negative

4589,Raquel F,not counting the commissions which with epark there were not of easy very little it is much more confusing than epark and also for greater inconvenience the obligatory geolocation as soon as the balance runs out i plan to uninstall it a shame that epark stops working because it was fucking great easypark no and it does not allow to return to epark come on all advantages and answering entering an address is another way to locate the vehicle with epark you only had to set the type of zone for the rate nothing more im sorry but after a week of use it seems infinitely worse more expensive less intuitive more intrusive and invasive of privacy etc i stand by my opinion,1,2020-12-11,15.14.1,-0.6675,,9986.0,negative

5117,Trezene,the old app was much better easier to use without the possibility of activating anything that you did not want now when you hit the wheel to choose the time you have to be very fine because you still havent set the parking time you need but accidentally when you turn you give it to start which is right in the center  the same thing happens to cancel you can do it without wanting to it would not be bad if i asked you for confirmation before either of those two actions or they put the buttons elsewhere or a less complicated system than turning the wheel to select the duration of your parking  anything i can think of is better than this in my city the blue zone ends at 900 pm but the app allows you to pay all night  to top it off prices have risen  im afraid im going back to coins easier and cheaper,2,2021-07-02,15.23.0,0.9097,,10514.0,positive

5141,Miguelms67,let epark come back  it was super easy  to leave paid the next day the application already began to count from 1000 in the morning the start time of regulated parking this one you turn the happy little wheel and you go by all the hours of the morning and you see how the money in euros continues to add up by god it is impossible to make it worse,1,2021-06-08,15.22.0,0.8877,,10538.0,positive
5142,DanCasRom,the ux is a far cry from the previous epark app the click to action for the payment method is terrible instead of putting the time and payment selector apart they put both on a wheel and the one that your finger goes slightly they charge you without prior confirmation the time marked in that moment by the wheel so that you cannot verify if it is correct or not nor cancel the payment i feel cheated exactly that has happened to me not being able to cancel the parking made by mistake because there is no button for it i wrote an email to the customer service email telling them what happened and attaching data and a screenshot they have called me by phone which i appreciate and the answer is that in madrid they cannot cancel or cancel errors because the city council does not allow them that option i understand that the city council can set some rules but if so then easypark should change the current design of the payment mode at least in madrid put separate buttons for selecting time and payment so that it is not so easy to make the mistake to pay for a parking that you do not want to do or for the unwanted time otherwise it will seem that they want to take advantage of all those charges committed by mistake i will report both the app and the city council to the consumer office because i honestly think it is a real scam towards users and customers of course i do not recommend anyone to use this app at least as long as they do not change the payment method,1,2021-06-07,15.22.0,-0.9707,,10539.0,negative

5172,Manurocker95,i have been using epark for a long time and was very happy with it it was easy to use and intuitive they have forced me to go to easy park and the change for the worse is brutal to begin with it is a lot less intuitive as another user mentions it makes no sense that for it to take you until 900 the next day you have to keep hitting the wheel in epark at 9 pm he was already jumping the next day after that he wont let you put on until 900 pm it must be at 859 pm if you get caught by one of traffic that minute you get a safe fine because that last minute is not covered afterwards i dont know if they dont have designers or ux but the little wheel thing is much worse than what there was before which was more like a half slider i really dont understand this change for the worse,1,2021-05-10,15.20.1,-0.6204,,10569.0,negative
