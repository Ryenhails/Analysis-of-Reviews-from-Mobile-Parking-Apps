3200,thadvnt79,used easyparks gps positioning to find the parking lot after the app identified exactly where i stood i started parking this resulted in a fine as easypark had marked the wrong tariff  code they take no responsibility at all for this im far from the only one who has been affected feel free to read other reviews and other users experience of easypark on eg trustpilot i see that i have received an answer from the app developer you should be extremely aware that the information presented in the app is not as simple as the app manufacturer wants it to appear also do not forget that easypark makes its money regardless of whether you as a user are fined or not but that says something about a parking company whose vision is to improve the urban experince instead of having the vision to help users easily park correctly and ensure that parking fines are avoided i want to claim that easyparks gps function helps to do the opposite and there are several reviews here from people who have experienced the same thing as me in addition the name of the app contributes to the problem as it is promised to be simple but in comparison with other services it is the direct opposite after further answers from where you claim that you want to try to help your customers as best as possible the statement remains that you fail with it quite often by the way still looking for the gallup survey that you refer to on your website regarding customer satisfaction and ang if i have been in contact with your customer service yes of course i have at first glance it looks like a professional answer but for anyone who has parked at some point and then been fined i dare say that your answer is perceived as extremely condescending for those of you who read this review really take a look at other peoples reviews also regarding easypark and its app and think about whether there might not be a better alternative when you park for example a company that also takes care of the fine and in this way actually has a much greater responsibility and thus better opportunities to really help parking customers than a company like easypark what if i had to pay the actual fee to easypark even though i was fined of course i got ,1,2020-06-12,15.8,0.9952,,3200.0,positive

5059,KMBmike,the app works perfectly so far but i installed it to save costs on shortterm parking but it doesnt work at allhere with us for example half an hour of parking costs 90 cents if you insert a coin this is also the minimum amount at the parking metersif i enter this parking time into the app ie 30 minutes or less eg 10 minutes easypark charges  136 extending the parking time to the minute only works to a limited extent so in the app yes but there are big leaps in terms of costs which are always more expensive than inserting coins despite the inside window sticker and paid parking time a parking attendant also wanted to issue a parking ticket which i saw in time when i referred to the sticker he just shrugged my shoulders  so when parking time is activated the app also says that you should put a note in the car  then what is the inside window sticker good forok if you dont have any change at hand then the app may make sense therefore 2 stars otherwise i recommend change firstly it is generally cheaper and secondly you avoid misunderstandings with the park attendantsthe app would be really useful among other things only if it would charge correspondingly little especially for shortterm parking of eg 10 minutes and not even charge more than you have to pay for half an hour by inserting a coin,2,2016-01-22,5.2,0.9676,,5059.0,positive

3037,brianrkf,edit thanks for your cheeky response easypark team unfortunately it was their app that made the mistake and not me thats why im very annoyed i chose the right zone without time limit have extended parking 2 times and the app only ended parking 25 minutes early without any error message or without me doing anything to control the app to end parking do not know what customer service will help me with then should i send you a signed confirmation from 3 family members who saw me extend the parking i can try then i can share my experience with other users here if there is any hidden illogical or unintuitive way to end parking that i was not made aware of in advance as other 1star reviewers here point out then it is again just bad design in their app users can not read developers thoughts  the app confirmed 2 times that i have demanded parking from 1215 to 1230 and then to 1245 still i was fined nok 600 because the parking was closed by itself at 1225 have no idea why i simply feel cheated whats the point of using this app and paying 15 extra when the result is that you get a fine anyway,1,2021-08-02,15.24.0,-0.7893,,8434.0,negative

3212,Vilde S. Jensen,hi the app is very handsome and lighthearted really useful for a busy everyday life one thing i think could have been an improvement is this with the choice of car and registration number here it is very easy to make mistakes as a user which for me and many others has resulted in a fine  despite the fact that you have actually paid but for a registration number that does not exist or a car that was obviously not in the parking lot one idea could be to have a twostep registration of car numbers so that it is easier to detect errors in registration if these two do not match or possibly a check against a register which means that the registration number that does not exist is not approved by the app and checks if the first two letters are in the registration number at all personally i missed f and pressed r in a hurry  and nr does not exist but the cure was there because this was my fault which i agree with despite the fact that i think the parking attendant should have looked for the car he had paid for and not found this and then looked between his fingers and thought here is someone who has been human to misprint in the app by improving it i have mentioned above i think the app would be more foolproof and even more would have enjoyed and trusted the app and that parking attendants do not have to take the brunt of the users mistakes  which is often awkward to admit as a user ,3,2019-03-03,12.6,0.9737,,8609.0,positive
