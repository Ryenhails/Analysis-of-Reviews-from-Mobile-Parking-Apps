3212,Vilde S. Jensen,hi the app is very handsome and lighthearted really useful for a busy everyday life one thing i think could have been an improvement is this with the choice of car and registration number here it is very easy to make mistakes as a user which for me and many others has resulted in a fine  despite the fact that you have actually paid but for a registration number that does not exist or a car that was obviously not in the parking lot one idea could be to have a twostep registration of car numbers so that it is easier to detect errors in registration if these two do not match or possibly a check against a register which means that the registration number that does not exist is not approved by the app and checks if the first two letters are in the registration number at all personally i missed f and pressed r in a hurry  and nr does not exist but the cure was there because this was my fault which i agree with despite the fact that i think the parking attendant should have looked for the car he had paid for and not found this and then looked between his fingers and thought here is someone who has been human to misprint in the app by improving it i have mentioned above i think the app would be more foolproof and even more would have enjoyed and trusted the app and that parking attendants do not have to take the brunt of the users mistakes  which is often awkward to admit as a user ,3,2019-03-03,12.6,0.9737,,8609.0,positive

3243,amcarmom,the app itself is very userfriendly what goes down horribly is that you can quickly get a parking ticket if you are not vigilant in other words do not use this app if you have a bad time are stressed or not when you park the car the app will find a parking machine for you and you will have an opportunity to pay there are several vending machines near each other and the app is just as happy to give you one that does not belong to the parking lot you are in once i was parked with several people i had paid correctly but three friends were fined for their cars next to mine because they had paid at the wrong vending machine i have now been fined myself because i have relied on the app in stress i have done everything right but have paid for an appliance that was a little further away and not for what belonged to my parking lot this was in the same parking lot and with a few meters in between so sum summarum the idea around the app usability etc is very good but it can quickly become expensive to use if you want to use this app you must each time go to the machine you find in the corresponding place you are in and then manually enter the machine id so it does not hold to see the machine over there a good  and necessary i mean  change on this app had to be that it on the map showed all the p machines around where you stood not just one,2,2018-12-12,11.7.1,0.589,,8640.0,positive

4556,Maria Garcia,after critical and even negative reviews and being able to communicate by phone with them i have to say that in my case the problem lies in a technical problem of information that the application gives the user which leads to confusion about the use and cost of the application app once explained by tony everything has been clarified and i have been able to confirm with my invoices that there is indeed no extra charge for the service i do not give 5  for this reason and i give it 4  for good customer service,4,2020-12-17,15.14.1,-0.9287,,9953.0,negative

5117,Trezene,the old app was much better easier to use without the possibility of activating anything that you did not want now when you hit the wheel to choose the time you have to be very fine because you still havent set the parking time you need but accidentally when you turn you give it to start which is right in the center  the same thing happens to cancel you can do it without wanting to it would not be bad if i asked you for confirmation before either of those two actions or they put the buttons elsewhere or a less complicated system than turning the wheel to select the duration of your parking  anything i can think of is better than this in my city the blue zone ends at 900 pm but the app allows you to pay all night  to top it off prices have risen  im afraid im going back to coins easier and cheaper,2,2021-07-02,15.23.0,0.9097,,10514.0,positive

5142,DanCasRom,the ux is a far cry from the previous epark app the click to action for the payment method is terrible instead of putting the time and payment selector apart they put both on a wheel and the one that your finger goes slightly they charge you without prior confirmation the time marked in that moment by the wheel so that you cannot verify if it is correct or not nor cancel the payment i feel cheated exactly that has happened to me not being able to cancel the parking made by mistake because there is no button for it i wrote an email to the customer service email telling them what happened and attaching data and a screenshot they have called me by phone which i appreciate and the answer is that in madrid they cannot cancel or cancel errors because the city council does not allow them that option i understand that the city council can set some rules but if so then easypark should change the current design of the payment mode at least in madrid put separate buttons for selecting time and payment so that it is not so easy to make the mistake to pay for a parking that you do not want to do or for the unwanted time otherwise it will seem that they want to take advantage of all those charges committed by mistake i will report both the app and the city council to the consumer office because i honestly think it is a real scam towards users and customers of course i do not recommend anyone to use this app at least as long as they do not change the payment method,1,2021-06-07,15.22.0,-0.9707,,10539.0,negative

5263,vicbarrera,despite going with the change of app we should have gone better it has not been like that when you are setting the time as you neglect and touch the button it is activated without asking you to confirm it and the worst thing is that it does not let you extend the time once activated in the history the trips he has made appear but what each one has cost does not come they are passing me charges by the bank that i do not recognize and when i go to check them i cannot because in the history they do not appear the only good thing is how quickly it locates the car in the area,1,2021-03-27,15.18.1,-0.2991,,10660.0,neutral
5266,Silviavg,it warns you that it will charge you when you open the app for the first time but the only option is to click accept i do not want to give it and it does not let me do anything if i enter epark it tells me that the data is already migrated balance included  to easypark i want to go back to epark and spend my balance there but right now i cant use either of the two applications scammers,1,2021-03-24,15.18.1,0.5134,,10663.0,positive
5267,Madrileña si,with epark they didnt even give me a regulated parking ticket it indicated the correct geolocation and the possible error of the cars situation not with the other applications of this type the first time i used this it geolocated the car in another area that was not the one it was in it does not warn of a possible distance error and the map does not distinguish well the situation of the car on the street nor the numbering of the same so it cannot be corrected well and as a consequence a nonvoidable fine i will not use it again,1,2021-03-24,15.18.1,-0.7124,,10664.0,negative

5271,Jucava,the other version was excellent  when my wife had to pay for parking it was super simple she would put her license plate and go now it is very cumbersome and requires each one to have their app i dont know if you are going to solve it  and as many say when you park you have to be moving the blue point until the parking place comes out it is a bit confusing  the other was super intuitive i imagine that you will fix it thanks,3,2021-03-22,15.18.1,0.938,,10668.0,positive
5272,Rebecapchsama,super dissatisfied with the app it is not easy to use and above all more expensive than before the payments pass days later the developers have shown off with an application that worked perfectly there is an app that is confusing and does not work well and a theft and without prior notice i hope they change it soon or i will stop using it i prefer to pay for a garage space than to be robbed every day,1,2021-03-21,15.18.1,0.3979,,10669.0,neutral

5277,Elians,lets see this morning i received a message saying that epark is now easypark i am going to park in half an hour and it already forces me to change couldnt you give us advance notice  leave a day for us to make the change  on the other hand the map is terrible in the nueva españa neighborhood in madrid the color is so dark that you cant see which street you have parked on  in the epark map there were references to shops offices hospitals that helped you to find yourself obviously i dont know the streets where i park  if i have an app it is to avoid going to the parking meter to check what neighborhood i am in or to look at which street i have parked  on the other hand i yes i am in madrid and the stop button is superfluous  it is easier for you to find a way to cancel the ticket in order to save it will not take 3 seconds but canceling it is too easy  these criticisms and i just put it  to those of epark thanks to the customers you have come this far you could already worry about having notified before and that the app will reach the standards that you had  to see if it improves and i can change the stars ,2,2021-03-16,15.17.1,0.9193,,10674.0,positive

5283,fjhorrillo,it leaves much to be desired compared to any other app of the style it charges you without confirmation when you set the time you do not know how much you are putting in and it is more than likely that when you turn the roulette you will hit it in the center and hire the ticket,,,,0.0,,10680.0,neutral
5285,Frasc0,very poorly designed the roulette system for time is very imprecise and as soon as you are careless it begins to count the time and when you stop it it is impossible to set time again you do not see the balance being transferred again or the amount loaded easily,1,2021-03-12,15.17.1,-0.3182,,10682.0,neutral

5322,javi tuby,problem with the location update you think that you are taking a ticket where you have parked and it turns out that it is located in a previous parking lot if you trust that it has picked up where you are and you do not check it you will have a surprise when you return to your car if you claim it and show that you were on the correct street but the application picks up a different one its answer is that it is your responsibility and be attentive what do you want this app for if it doesnt do it automatically do not trust yourself and check well where it locates you,1,2020-11-11,15.12.1,0.102,,10719.0,neutral
